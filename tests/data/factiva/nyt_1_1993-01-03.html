<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS, Jan. 8 -- A team of European Community investigators has estimated that 20,000 Muslim women have been raped by Bosnian Serb soldiers in recent months as part of a deliberate pattern of abuse aimed at driving them from their homes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team said there were indications that some rapes were carried out "in particularly sadistic ways so as to inflict maximum humiliation on the victims." The report did not elaborate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said it had also received strong evidence that "many women, and more particularly children, may have died during or after rape." The report did not give the range of ages of the victims or say how many might have died. Systematic Assaults Assailed  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that most incidents of rape occurred during Bosnian Serb military attacks on Muslim communities, the team concluded that "rape cannot be seen as incidental to the main purposes of the aggression but as serving a strategic purpose in itself." Refugees have described the rapes in the past in extensive interviews.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ordering the investigation at a meeting in Edinburgh last month, community leaders strongly condemned the "systematic" detention and rape of Muslim women "to achieve the purpose of ethnic cleansing" as a crime against humanity and warned that those responsible would be brought to justice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team, which has already visited Muslim refugees in Croatia and plans to travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina later this month, is headed by Dame Anne Warburton, a former British diplomat, and comprises Simone Veil, a prominent French politician, as well as medical, legal and other experts. Compiling Statistics  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interim report to community foreign ministers, which was made available just two days before peace talks between Bosnia's three belligerent parties resume in Geneva, the mission said it was aware that rape and sexual abuse were not limited to Muslims or even to women.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Muslim women undoubtedly form the vast majority of rape victims," it said. "However, there are also disturbing reports of Croat and Serbian women as well as sexual abuse of men in detention camps." The team's specific mission was nonetheless to investigate treatment of Muslim women.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It further noted that, given the widespread displacement of people and the continuing conflict in many areas, "the inherent difficulties involved in compiling statistics on rape and other sexual abuse have been hugely accentuated in the current chaotic conditions."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the five-page report said the team became convinced that "many thousands" of Muslim women had suffered rape and that "this was continuing." And it said, "The most reasoned estimate suggested to the delegation indicated a figure in the region of 20,000 victims."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Noting that it was repeatedly told that rape was being used as "a weapon of war," the team said it "accepted the view that rape is part of a pattern of abuse, usually perpetrated with the conscious intention of demoralizing and <b>terrorizing</b> communities, driving them from their home regions and demonstrating the power of the invading force." The report did not mention specific towns or areas affected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Probably in most cases, other forms of physical and mental violence to persons were associated with rape, accompanied or followed by the destruction of homes, mosques and churches," it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said the team repeatedly heard accounts of multiple rapes against women in camps and in places like houses, restaurants and police stations, but had been unable to verify those reports.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It said that a census being carried out among refugees in Croatia should determine if many Muslim women of reproductive age are missing, either killed or held captive. Other Atrocities Noted  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report said the team had been unable to estimate the number of Bosnian Muslim women who have become pregnant as a result of rape, but it noted that the problem of adoption will have to be addressed because "many of the women concerned are likely not to wish to keep children conceived in such circumstances." It did not say whether any victims had indicated that they had received abortions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recommending emergency help for rape victims, the team said there was an urgent need for experts in rape and sexual abuse counseling in Croatia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without skilled and appropriate counseling, long-term psychological disturbance with risk of suicide will be the chief result," it said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It urged community governments to help train counselors and to step up financial assistance to enable the Croatian and Bosnian Governments to cope with the problem. It also suggested that community governments speed up visa procedures for Bosnian refugees and give temporary asylum to Bosnian Muslim women in need of medical attention.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The report added that the delegation was aware that "rape cannot be considered in isolation from other atrocities," adding, "Life and property are being destroyed on a massive scale, with violations of the most basic rights."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: A Bosnian woman from the town of Prijedor in Bosnia and Herzegovina wept last month while describing to a team of investigators how Serbian captors repeatedly raped her and her 16-year-old daughter last July. She also said her husband and two sons were still missing. (Nina Berman/Sipa Press)(pg. 4)  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jan. 8 -- Serbian nationalist troops besieging Sarajevo shot and killed a top official of the Bosnian Government today after halting a United Nations armored vehicle that was carrying him from Sarajevo airport into the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Members of a hard-line faction in the Government immediately announced that they would not return to peace talks with their Serbian nationalist opponents until they were given convincing assurances that the Serbs were genuinely seeking peace.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">[ Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, said in New York that his Government was discussing whether "to withdraw the Bosnian delegation from the negotiations" in Geneva, The Associated Press reported. Speaking at Kennedy Airport, where he met with Vice President-elect Al Gore before returning to Bosnia, he said he didn't know whether a decision had been made. ] Appeal for Restraint  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The slain official, Hakija Turajlic, was one of three Deputy Prime Ministers of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, which has been struggling to survive a war with a secessionist army of Serbian nationalists. Mr. Turajlic was in charge of economic policy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, the United Nations commander for Bosnia and Herzegovina, called the killing "one of the most detestable violations in this conflict."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon, fearing that the incident could provide the spark for a major Bosnian counteroffensive, appealed to both sides for restraint.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a catastrophe," he said after an emergency meeting with the top officers of the 7,500-man United Nations military force. "I will try to convince everybody that it is perhaps not the reason to start the war again, but perhaps on the contrary a reason for everybody to understand that this tragedy has to stop as soon as possible."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The killing took place as Mr. Turajlic, 47 years old, was inside an armored personnel carrier belonging to the French marine battalion assigned to the United Nations forces. The vehicle, painted white and bearing the blue United Nations flag and insignia, was halted about 500 yards from the airport exit gate by two Serbian tanks and what General Morillon described as a force of 30 to 40 Serbian soldiers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon said the Serbian troops demanded that the three French soldiers operating the vehicle hand over Mr. Turajlic. The soldiers radioed for help and were joined by the French officer who commands the airport, Col. Patrice Sartre. A confrontation lasting one hour and 45 minutes ensued, which ended with a Serbian soldier thrusting his automatic weapon over Colonel Sartre's shoulder and firing at Mr. Turajlic through the vehicle's open rear door.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general said that Mr. Turajlic, who joined the Bosnian Government last year after serving as managing director of an industrial conglomerate in the former Yugoslavia, was struck by seven bullets, three in the chest, and died instantly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon said that the Serbian soldiers withdrew from the scene immediately, and that Colonel Sartre, acting under United Nations rules of engagement that allow soldiers to open fire only to save lives, decided not to fire back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon said Mr. Turajlic had requested a United Nations armored vehicle to take him to the airport, along a notoriously dangerous route that runs between Serbian and Bosnian front lines, when the United Nations headquarters was unable to make arrangements for a Turkish Government delegation to enter the city. The general said that the Turkish officials had arrived at the airport aboard a Turkish aircraft at lunchtime, with virtually no advance notice, and that United Nations officers had agreed to take Mr. Turajlic to meet the Turkish officials at the airport.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Serbian troops rushed onto the road ahead of the United Nations vehicle as it returned to Sarajevo at 4:30 P.M., dusk in the Balkans at this time of year. General Morillon said the Serbian soldiers had told the French soldiers that they had seen the Turkish aircraft and knew that it had carried 150 Turkish troops to join the Bosnian forces in the defense of Sarajevo. General Morillon said the Turkish aircraft had carried relief supplies..  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general said that he had ordered an inquiry to establish several key points, including why the French marines, outnumbered 10 to 1, had not been reinforced during the protracted standoff by other soldiers from the French battalion that has its headquarters at an airport garrison that is within sight of the spot where the killing occurred. The general also said he wanted to know why the rear door of the armored vehicle had been opened, against normal procedures here. "I think it was because the Serbian soldiers wanted to inspect the vehicle for weapons," he said. Following U.N. Guidelines  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The general said Colonel Sartre's decison not to call in more French marines followed established United Nations practice here. He said Serbian nationalist forces had repeatedly halted United Nations armored vehicles at gunpoint, ordered their doors opened and searched the vehicles, usually on the pretext that they were carrying arms for the Bosnian forces. Normally, the general said, such incidents are resolved without resort to force. "We are not prepared for such madness," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have asked the Serbian side not only to arrest the author of this assassination, and they say he is under arrest, but also to arrest the commanding officer responsible for the decision that had these results."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the United Nations force, the killing was the second major embarrassment in four days. On Tuesday, the operators of a home for the elderly that is only 750 yards from the United Nations headquarters on the embattled western edge of Sarajevo announced that 10 residents had died in 36 hours of the zero-degree cold that has settled over the Bosnian capital. Their deaths brought to 190 out of 302 residents at the home who have died since the Bosnian war began last April.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Employees at the home had appealed to United Nations commanders for help in evacuating the residents from the battle zone for at least four months, and, if evacuation was impossible, for wood-burning heaters to stave off the bitter Balkan winter. But because of what United Nations officials described as a failure of communications, nothing was done for the residents of the home apart from weekly deliveries of food supplies, even after all electricity in Sarajevo failed and cut off the home's only heating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even before the setbacks this week, the United Nations force here appeared to be in serious trouble. It has operated under a mandate that limits it to negotiation with the warring sides, and the rival factions have repeatedly taken advantage of this lack of military authority. Blow for U.N. Commander  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon, 57, who took command of the force in September, appeared to take today's killing as a personal blow. The United Nations force has had 17 of its own men killed, many of them by mortar and sniper fire from Serbian or Bosnian troops around Sarajevo.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But General Morillon, like his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Lewis W. Mackenzie of Canada, has consistently spoken out against the alternative to the United Nations peacekeeping force, which many believe should include Western military intervention.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">General Morillon named the officer commanding the Serbian troops who carried out the killing as Gen. Stanislav Galic, a top commander of the Serbian fighters in Bosnia and Herzegovina, most of whom belonged to the Yugoslav Army garrison stationed in Sarajevo before Bosnia declared its independence. General Galic's tanks, artillery and antiaircraft guns have inflicted most of the heaviest damage on Sarajevo, where an estimated 55,000 people have been killed or wounded during the siege.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The leaders of the Serbian nationalist cause in Bosnia were reported to be attending a meeting in the eastern Bosnian town of Zvornik. General Morillon said he had been told that the session was to decide policy for the resumption of the Geneva peace talks, where both Serbian and Bosnian Government leaders have balked at a joint United Nations-European Community plan to divide Bosnia into semiautonomous regions under a weak central government. Peace Talks in Doubt  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ejup Ganic, a Bosnian vice president, said that the decision not to resume negotiations in Geneva had been made "here, in Sarajevo, by those running the Government" in the absence of President Izetbegovic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a great tragedy," Mr. Ganic said. "Hakija Turajlic was absolutely the most efficient, competent minister in this Government."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think we shouldn't go to continue talks in Geneva unless the aggressors show that they are for peace," Mr. Ganic said. "If we continue like this, they will kill each of us, one by one, until there is no Government left."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The killing appeared likely to strengthen hard-liners in the Bosnian Government, including Mr. Ganic, who have differed with Mr. Izetbegovic in the past over his decision to continue negotiations with the Serbian nationalists. Mr. Ganic and the Bosnian military commander, Maj. Sefer Halilovic, have taken the position that any negotiated settlement with the Serbian nationalists, who now occupy about two-thirds of the republic, would amount to a surrender, and that the Bosnia Muslims should resolve to fight on, regardless of the costs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the United Nations, in New York, the Security Council said in a statement that it was "profoundly shocked" to learn of the killing of Mr. Turajlic "while he was under the protection of the United Nations Protection Force." The Council called his death an "outrageous act of <b>terrorism</b>," a "grave violation of international humanitarian law" and "a flagrant challange to the authority of the United Nations force.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Council also asked Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to investigate in the killing and report back "without delay."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. forces in Somalia still operate under a confusing mandate in ever more perilous circumstances. The perils were underscored yesterday when 400 marines attacked the camp of Mogadishu's treacherous warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. But does this clash, the fiercest since Americans landed, really signal a more aggressive stance on seizing weapons?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was confusion earlier this week on just what weapons should be taken from the roving gangs that prey on a stricken people. At first, seized weapons were returned to their owners; now there's a different rule. "If it's American-made and I see it, it's mine," a Marine sergeant told The Washington Post. "I can't touch an AK-47. I wish I could. But if it's American, it's mine."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Washington, a much clearer policy was advanced by Robert Oakley, the U.S. special envoy. The focus, he said, should be on "collecting" heavy weapons: weapons mounted on vehicles, recoilless rifles, rocket launchers, mortars and antitank weapons. Not only have these weapons done the most damage to civilians, Mr. Oakley said, "but they're the symbols of power."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's a more valid distinction, and a more enforceable policy, than the made-in-America instructions. Until heavy weapons are seized, or "collected," there can't be the "secure environment" for delivering food -- the avowed goal of Operation Restore Hope.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These heavy weapons are the very sinews of power. They <b>terrorize</b> civilians and murder relief workers. Their presence is also a reminder of the superpower rivalry that led Washington and Moscow to send huge supplies of arms to a crafty Somali tyrant who first tilted East, then West. The handover of these weapons to the U.S.-led coalition may not be a sufficient, but is surely a necessary, condition for social peace.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington has no wish to favor any leader or faction. The logical corollary is to collect or seize heavy weapons from all clan armies. An offer to swap farm implements or other goods for weapons might speed this process. But clear marching orders are needed first.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At West Point, President Bush struggled inconclusively this week to establish general principles for armed intervention. But in Somalia, the U.S. has flunked the simpler test of defining rules of engagement on the ground. </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Culprit" is short for "culpable: prit d'averrer nostre bille," an Anglo-Norman phrase meaning "I am ready to aver our indictment." It was what court officials in old England uttered when a defendant pleaded not guilty.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hamilton Burger might have liked the word "immaterial," but Samuel Johnson hated it. "This sense has crept into the conversation and writings of barbarians, but ought to be utterly rejected," he wrote.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lynching is named for Capt. William Lynch, who in 1780, along with his neighbors in Pittsylvania County, Va., set up a way of punishing people who they believed had transgressed with impunity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The guillotine bears the name of Joseph Guillotin, an 18th-century French doctor who campaigned for more humane executions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The newly published third edition of the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, wherein these etymological gems appear, is testament to the innumerable ways in which law has long colored the English language.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if this dictionary offers a history lesson, it is also an unusual window on contemporary popular culture. The word "legalese," defined as "the specialized vocabulary of the legal profession, especially when considered to be complex or abstruse," makes its debut therein -- and rightly so, for nowhere is the accelerating infiltration of law, lawyers and legal culture into the American mainstream so neatly documented than in this 2,140-page tome.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The number and kind of entries reflects the growing influence of the law in our culture as well as the litigiousness and violence of society," said Anne H. Soukhanov, executive editor of the dictionary. "Our language overall has become so complex that words that would have been relegated to the annals of bar have become mainstrain items in the adult lexicon."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Indeed, the law profession's influence on English led Ms. Soukhanov and her colleagues to name the dictionary's first-ever law consultant: Robert M. Landis, a longtime partner at the Philadelphia law firm Dechert, Price &amp; Rhodes and past director of Houghton Mifflin, the dictionary's publisher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's extremely dangerous for editors to try to handle these definitions in house," Ms. Soukhanov said, noting that entries often make their way into legal briefs. "You absolutely have to have an attorney look at them."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For six weeks that's what Mr. Landis did, poring over definitions of "abortion" and "privilege," "obstruction of justice" and "diminished capacity," "probable cause" and "consortium," trying to make them more accurate, accessible, concise and gender-neutral. Also in his marching orders: recommending deletions of all legalisms he deemed hopelessly archaic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He came up with dozens, including "jus gentium," "mare clausum" and "curtilage." In the end, though, tradition won out, and only five were trimmed. "Abuttal," "ad rem," "damnify," "deforciant" and "mittimus" aside, it is far easier to add a word to a dictionary than to take one out.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As public attitudes change, so does legal doctrine and, eventually, legal terminology. Many of the newest entries have come, unsurprisingly, from the emotionally charged arena of sexual politics. Among those terms making their first appearance are "date rape," "sexual harassment" and "battered woman syndrome."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rampant criminality has contributed entries like "serial killer," "air <b>terrorism</b>" and "death qualify" (to excuse opponents of the death penalty from serving on a jury). There are terms from the drug culture, like narcokleptocracy (a group of people doing business with dealers). To "Mirandize" is to inform a suspect of his legal rights, as required under the so-called Miranda rules.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The dictionary cites such contemporary legal voices as Benno C. Schmidt Jr. (Yale, he once maintained, was a "crucible" in American life) and Richard M. Nixon (under "stonewall," as in "I want you to stonewall it; let them plead the Fifth Amendment").  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But one must use modernity in moderation. Take one word that isn't in the dictionary, the verb "Bork," which might be defined as "to destroy a judicial nominee through a concerted attack on his character, background and philosophy." The term has already appeared in The New Republic, Newsweek, The Chicago Tribune and other publications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Landis likes the word. "There's something about the sound of it that's onomatopoetic," he said. But Ms. Soukhanov is not yet convinced that the would-be Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Bork is ready to join Messrs. Lynch, Guillotin and Miranda in the illustrious ranks of eponyms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's one we're watching very carefully right now," she said. "If anyone else gets Borked when Clinton starts putting up nominees for the Supreme Court, there's a darn good chance that the word will make it into the dictionary."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 7 -- For months, the Bush Administration and the Clinton team have portrayed the Bosnian Muslims as victims of unspeakable acts of murder, rape, <b>terror</b> and "ethnic cleansing" at the hands of the Serbs. But when the leader of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government came to town today looking for help, neither the old or new Administrations were quite sure what to do with him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The visit by the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, cast in a very personal light the quandary facing the United States: how to respond to a war and a humanitarian tragedy that has evoked widespread public sympathy but little enthusiasm for forceful military intervention in the West.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the problems was Mr. Izetbegovic's timing. He arrived as Cyrus R. Vance, a United Nations special envoy and former Secretary of State, argued that his negotiating process in Geneva had reached a crucial stage. Concern Over Peace Effort  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although neither the Bush Administration nor the Clinton team has fully embraced that process, neither side wanted to risk sabotaging it either by appearing to strengthen Mr. Izetbegovic's hand or encouraging him to stiffen his demands.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Izetbegovic, who came to Washington as the guest of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, denied in an interview today that he was seeking meetings with senior officials of either the Administration or the Clinton camp, but that if asked he would be delighted to accept.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My intention was to explain to the American public through the media our views about the peace plan and the extremely difficult humanitarian situation, especially in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. "It was not to see either the old or the new Administration. But of course, if I have some opportunity to meet some of them, that is O.K." Meetings With Officials  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his visit, he is meeting with members of Congress, and conducting interviews with newspapers, magazines and television networks. But his advisers and his hosts acknowledged that they lobbied behind the scenes for invitations from President Bush and President-elect Bill Clinton. And the Bosnian leader's presence clearly caused some diplomatic anguish for both groups.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the Clinton team supports the Bosnian Muslims' cause, it does not want to be seen posing for photographs or making promises to their leader before it takes office. Hours after Mr. Izetbegovic arrived for his two-day visit, senior officials in the Clinton team were still debating who should meet with him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jenonne Walker, a Clinton transition official assigned to the State Department, told one representative from the Carnegie Endowment on Wednesday that she and Madeleine Albright, the nominee for chief delegate to the United Nations, would meet with Mr. Izetbegovic. But Leon Fuerth, an aide to the Clinton national security team, told another Carnegie representative that he would conduct the meeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By this afternoon, the Clinton foreign policy team decided that Mr. Fuerth and Ms. Walker would meet with the Bosnian leader on Friday, a senior Clinton aide said. Clinton Aides Unavailable  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vice President-elect Al Gore, who had met quietly with the Bosnian Foreign Minister, Haris Silajdzic, in Washington last month, was in Little Rock today and was scheduled to be in Texas on Friday to participate in Mr. Clinton's meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, the official said. Samuel R. Berger, the deputy national security adviser-designate, was not available because he was leaving this evening for the Texas meeting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Warren M. Christopher, the Secretary of State-designate, was unavailable because he has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, the official said. When asked why W. Anthony Lake, the national security adviser-designate, who would be in town on Friday, could not meet with Mr. Izetbegovic, the official replied that Mr. Gore and Mr. Berger were the officials who "have met all along for the last four months with foreign ministers and ambassadors." He added, "You cannot imagine the number of people who want to meet Christopher and Lake, and until Jan. 20, we are still a transition."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was just as much indecision in the Bush camp. Bush Administration officials initially told Carnegie Endowment representatives that both Mr. Eagleburger and perhaps even Mr. Bush would meet with the Bosnian Muslim leader, according to Carnegie officials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That changed when Mr. Vance, concerned that Mr. Izetbegovic might abandon the negotiations, telephoned Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and asked him not to meet with the Bosnian leader, and to insure that no one at the White House did either, according to aides to Mr. Vance and senior Administration officials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Eagleburger agreed, and the Bosnians were informed late Wednesday night that there would probably be no high-level meetings. But when Mr. Vance's request was disclosed today in The New York Times, Mr. Eagleburger changed his mind, the officials added. The State Department called the Bosnian mission to the United Nations this morning to set up a meeting, and by this afternoon, the White House called Mr. Izetbegovic's entourage to offer a meeting with Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Izetbegovic is now scheduled to meet with Mr. Eagleburger and Mr. Scowcroft on Friday.  </p>

</div><div class="author">By A. M. ROSENTHAL   </div><div>736 Wörter</div><div>8 Januar 1993</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>25</div><div>Englisch</div><div>Copyright 1993 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.   </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the past few days, I have been experiencing a political sensation new to me -- flashes of sympathy for the German Government.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late November and December last year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, backed by German parliamentary leaders, took an important step to try to control the wave of Nazi killings, beatings, burnings and riots.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now some Western supporters of human rights are beginning to jump all over the poor fellow for his action -- banning two Nazi parties.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a letter printed in The New York Times on Christmas Day, two high officials of Human Rights Watch, a usually persistent, effective watchdog group, attacked Mr. Kohl on two counts.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They complained about changes in the German asylum law making it much more difficult for foreigners to get asylum -- and they were right. The way to deal with violence against foreigners is to hunt down and jail the criminals, not to imply that somehow it was the number of refugees and their countries of origin that were to blame. Coming from a nation that created more refugees in a month than it now accepts in a decade -- to say nothing about corpses -- that does not sit well in the stomach.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the two officials, Jeri Laber and Gara LaMarche, also wrote about how "deeply disturbed" they were that the Nazi parties had been banned. They said that was "casting too broad" a net, would turn bigots into victims, drive the Nazis underground and create a more attractive home for the "unstable and insecure who are drawn to such groups."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The chances are we will be hearing a lot more of this "civil liberties" attack against banning German Nazi parties. So this is a good time for Westerners involved in the struggle for human rights to look at the whole issue straight and openly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nazis who carried out the crimes will not stop hating, not stop killing, working and hoping for a new Hitler because the two parties are banned, not a prayer of that.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the argument that being banned will automatically help the Nazis is full of moral and political holes. The banned parties provided some of the inspiration and backing for the Nazi outrages that shocked Germany and the entire West last year. Banning the parties conceivably could slow them down. At least it might save the lives of some of the foreigners the Nazis might otherwise have killed or <b>terrorized</b>.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The kind of people attracted to Nazism -- there is no such thing as neo-Nazis, just plain Nazis -- take courage from the organized killer-pack and political cover that Nazi parties give them. They are bullies and killers, not just insecure creatures. They are attracted and strengthened by the uniforms, paraphernalia and the protection the parties give them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, about the "human rights" issues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">German governments have one overriding human right to protect --the right of Germans and all others to be protected from any danger of repetition of the hellish history of Germany itself. Legal action against Nazis is permissible under German law that recognizes that duty -- the obligation that made Germany even theoretically acceptable again among civilized nations.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Would I support banning Nazi parties in America? No -- because this country has had the God-sent and man-protected good fortune not to have lived under or created Nazism.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But yes, absolutely yes, I would support a ban if the United States had ever been so stricken, so evil, as to have chosen a Nazi government, if it had turned ever into a country where the government had slaughtered all men, women and children whose religion or skin color made them officially unfit to live -- slaughtered them while most other Americans stood by, or cheered.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It strikes me as faintly obscene for Americans so blessed by accident of birthplace as not to have lived under Nazism to denounce any Germans who now use every legal weapon against those who fight to recreate the German hell on earth.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The least the rest of us can do is to recognize and applaud those Germans who say "never again" by marching in the streets against Nazis, and those who say it by taking all available legal action against them.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Democracy need not be a suicide pact -- or the gateway to the gas chamber. But we remember it can be both -- don't we?   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cuban exile community is suffering from collective dementia and hate-filled fanaticism, or so we ought to believe from Ruth Behar's Dec. 18 Op-Ed article. This shared hatred of Fidel Castro, according to Ms. Behar, has given sustenance to an aggressive United States policy toward Cuba. She invites President-elect Clinton to reconsider his commitment to the Cuban Democracy Act, which prohibits United States subsidiaries from trading with Cuba, and thereby rescue United States-Cuba relations from the cold war.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I write as director of Puente de Jovenes Profesionales Cubanos, which means Bridge of Young Cuban Professionals. We too are interested in building bridges to our beloved homeland. However, we seek to build bridges of hope and freedom with the Cuban people and not with Fidel Castro's regime.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite overwhelming support inside and outside Cuba and among the old as well as the young for tougher embargo measures against the Castro Government, Ms. Behar tells us she represents a new generation of younger Cuban-Americans who feel trapped and frustrated with what seems a dead-end United States policy of aggression, the inference being that if you are determined to work for policies that aim to undermine the Castro regime, you are a fanatic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Cuba there are nearly 11 million such fanatics, desperate to end Mr. Castro's hold on their miserable lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Behar proposes that President-elect Clinton allow creation of "cultural and emotional ties" among all the Cuban people. Perhaps she does not remember when Jimmy Carter tried his hand at peace with Havana. The result: Fidel Castro unleashed the Mariel exodus, which sent Cuba's hardened criminals and mental patients to United States shores to <b>terrorize</b> the American population and discredit the Cuban exile community.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To contemplate cultural bridges with a country governed by Fidel Castro is sheer fancy. The only culture that exists in Cuba is Fidel Castro's political preservation, animated by his dictum, "Everything within the revolution, nothing outside of it."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My organization supports the principles behind such creative policy initiatives as the Cuban Democracy Act, the internationalization of the Cuban embargo, United Nations condemnation for Cuba's human rights abuses, Radio Marti and TV Marti, and others. These are the true bridges, which will unite one people divided too long by one man. MARCO A. SAINZ JR. Miami, Dec. 23, 1992 </p>

</div><div class="author">By JOHN J. O'CONNOR  </div><div>758 Wörter</div><div>7 Januar 1993</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>13</div><div>Englisch</div><div>Copyright 1993 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Enterprise is still the name of the "Star Trek" game, in the sense not of difficult undertaking but of business venture. Created by Gene Roddenberry, the original "Star Trek" series, not very successful in its initial run, made its debut on NBC-TV in September 1966 and, three years and 79 episodes later, turned out to be a megahit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It has since spawned a cartoon series, more than 100 novelizations, 6 movies and a blockbuster syndicated series called "Star Trek: The Next Generation," for which Mr. Roddenberry returned as executive producer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What next? Well, of course, despite the death of Mr. Roddenberry in 1991, what else but still another syndicated series? Being announced as a two-hour movie across the country these days, tonight at 8 o'clock on WPIX-TV, Channel 11, is "Star Trek: Deep Space 9," promising in its ads to offer "a new Star Trek era," enticingly adding, "Welcome to the dark side."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The determinedly optimistic Mr. Roddenberry was partial to stories that made uplifting moral points. The new creators and executive producers, Rick Berman and Michael Piller, are shooting, so to speak, for something more ambivalent, less perfect.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As in "The Next Generation," the time is the 24th century, some eight decades beyond the original "Star Trek." A preface explains how the Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of the Enterprise, played by Patrick Stewart, a guest star on the premiere, was somehow kidnapped and "surgically altered" by invaders and then forced to lead an assault on his own Starfleet. That is the opening scene, in which Lieut. Comdr. Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) of the Saratoga, after finding his wife among the fatalities, barely escapes the dastardly attack with his teen-age son Jake (Cirroc Lofton). Sisko will obviously harbor no great love for Picard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years later. Now a commander himself, Sisko is sent to Deep Space 9, an abandoned space station orbiting the planet Bajor, long occupied and pillaged by Cadassians, who have now moved on. Sisko has to help the Bajorans recover. That's the core plot. The rest is an intriguing exercise in reshaping an established formula to contemporary specifications that include hearty dollops of political correctness and multi-culturalism that the original "Star Trek" rarely considered.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Played with a winning combination of authority and bemusement by Mr. Brooks ("Spenser, for Hire"), Commander Sisko is black and quite articulate about the "son I am raising alone." Bajor's First Officer, Maj. Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor), a former <b>terrorist</b>, is a woman. A security officer, Odo (Rene Auberjonois), who can go through "Terminator 2"-like "morphing" changes, is not happy with the continuing presence of Quark (Armin Shimerman), an odd-looking Ferengi who controls the entertainment concessions, including a holographic brothel in which sex cannot be safer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the movie tonight is preoccupied with simply introducing those and several other characters, all of whom will be prominent in the series. Along the way, Sisko is introduced to phenomena like Orbs, which are mystical icons, and wormholes that enable instant travel to the past. A Celestial Temple is thrown in for good measure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are serious moments, as when Sisko tries to explain to his son the essence of a linear existence by teaching him baseball ("In the end it comes down to throwing one pitch after another"). And there are bits of near camp. "If you don't take that hand off my hip," Major Kira warns the irascible Quark, "you'll never be able to raise a drink again."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gushes Quark, "Oh, I love a woman in uniform!"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Traditional Trekkies may object to the grit and occasional flippancy of the cheeky spinoff. The rest of us are likely to feel, at least for the time being, fairly optimistic about the future of "Deep Space 9." Mr. Brooks's performance alone is certainly encouraging. Star Trek Deep Space 9 Channel 11, 8 P.M.

<div id="hd"><span class="enHeadline">Rudolf Nureyev, Charismatic Dancer Who Gave Fire to Ballet's Image, Dies at 54  </span>
</div><div class="author">By JACK ANDERSON  </div><div>2753 Wörter</div><div>7 Januar 1993</div><div>The New York Times</div><div>NYTF</div><div>Late Edition - Final</div><div>19</div><div>Englisch</div><div>Copyright 1993 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved.  </div>
<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rudolf Nureyev, one of the most charismatic ballet stars of the 20th century and an artist who was often called the greatest male dancer since Vaslav Nijinsky, died yesterday in a hospital near Paris. He was 54 and had homes in Paris, New York City and St. Bart's in the Caribbean.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He died of "a cardiac complication, following a grievous illness," his physician, Michel Canesi, said. Dr. Canesi would not elaborate on the illness. "Following Mr. Nureyev's wishes, I can't say any more," he said. Many of Mr. Nureyev's friends said he had AIDS. He entered the Hopital Notre Dame du Perpetuel Secours in Levallois, a suburb of Paris, on Nov. 22.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev's defection from the Soviet Union in 1961 made headlines around the world, and he remained in the public eye for nearly 30 years with a riveting stage presence that mesmerized audiences and attracted millions of new fans to ballet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During his career as a performer, Mr. Nureyev also choreographed, restaged many classics, served as the Paris Opera Ballet's artistic director and tried his hand as a ballet and orchestral conductor. Life and dance were one for Mr. Nureyev.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When he defected from the Kirov Ballet while it was on tour in Paris, American and Western European audiences were already familiar with great male dancers. Some were more elegant and precise than Mr. Nureyev was at the height of his powers. But when he burst on the scene, with his long hair, hollow cheeks and fiery expression, he performed with an intensity that startled and excited dancegoers. A Chief Popularizer Of Classical Ballet  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At his peak, Mr. Nureyev combined a passionate, arrogant temperament with a perfectionist's standards. Upon his arrival in the West, he immediately became one of ballet's chief popularizers through his contemporary approach to the 19th-century classics and his legendary partnership with Dame Margot Fonteyn of the Royal Ballet. His personal obsession with dance was well known, inspiring him to master a bewildering variety of styles and to embark upon seemingly never-ending tours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev was above all a stickler for classical technique, and his mastery of it made him a model for an entire generation of dancers. If the standard of male dancing rose so visibly in the West after the 1960's, it was largely because of Mr. Nureyev's inspiration. He showed dancers how to jump an extra measure higher and not to be afraid of the grand manner. The public flocked to see him and he was often compared with rock stars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Richard Buckle, the dance critic for The Sunday Times of London, described Mr. Nureyev in a review in 1962 as "A pop dancer -- that's what we've got -- a pop dancer, at last.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What the telly did for art, what Billy Graham did for religion, Nureyev has done for ballet."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Oleg Kerensky, another British critic, observed in 1970: "Part of Nureyev's sensational success is due to his animal magnetism and sensuality. He appeals to the mothering instinct in middle-aged women, the mating instinct in young ones and the desire of many male homosexuals." Born on a Train In Southeast Siberia  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Mr. Nureyev became an Austrian citizen in 1982, he was essentially a citizen of the entire Western dancing world. Yet he received his first dance lessons in a remote Soviet city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rudolf Hametovich Nureyev was born on March 17, 1938, on a train traveling along the shores of Lake Baikal in southeastern Siberia. His father, of Bashkir Muslim descent, was in the Soviet Army, an itinerant political instructor for soldiers posted throughout the Soviet Union. His mother, Farida, was reportedly a Tatar from Kazan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Nureyevs lived in Moscow for part of World War II. The family, which included three daughters, then moved to Ufa, a city on the eastern side of the Ural Mountains that is the capital of Bashkiria, a region within the Russian republic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two sisters survive Mr. Nureyev: Rosa, who lives in the south of France, and sister, Rezida, who lives in Russia but who reportedly went to Paris recently to be near her brother.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was at the Ufa Opera that Mr. Nureyev first saw ballet performances. Enraptured, he began to work with folk-dance groups at his school and to take ballet lessons with a local teacher, eventually becoming an apprentice member of the corps de ballet at the Ufa Opera House.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although his father tried to discourage his interest in dance, he appeared with other members of the Ufa Ballet in Moscow in 1955. After auditions, he was accepted by the schools of both the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad. He chose the Kirov even though one of the teachers who auditioned him there said, "Young man, you'll become either a brilliant dancer or a total failure -- and most likely you'll be a failure."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Challenged, Mr. Nureyev had the luck to be taken under the wing of one of the Kirov's best teachers, Aleksandr Pushkin. At his graduation in 1958, Mr. Nureyev joined the Kirov Ballet. Skipping the corps level, he was given solo roles from the outset. He regularly partnered Natalya Dudinskaya, the company's senior ballerina and the wife of its director, Konstantin Sergeyev. Curiosity About Foreign Dancers  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev also gained a reputation as an unpredictable individualist. He took little interest in politics but aroused the suspicion of Communist officials by his curiosity about the foreign attractions that visited Leningrad. He was absent when American Ballet Theater performed there but he asked a friend to film some performances. Erik Bruhn, the great Danish dancer in that troupe, overwhelmed him with his elegance and aristocratic reserve, qualities different from Mr. Nureyev's own flamboyance. Asked later if he found Mr. Bruhn a cool dancer, he replied, "Cool, yes -- so cool that it burns." Soon after Mr. Nureyev defected, he and Mr. Bruhn became close friends.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That defection occurred on June 17, 1961. The Kirov had just finished its season in Paris and was going on to London. But Mr. Nureyev was told that he was being sent to Moscow to dance at a gala. He suspected that this was a way of punishing him for his unruliness, and that once in the Soviet Union, he would no longer be allowed out. When he arrived at Le Bourget airport with the rest of the company, Mr. Nureyev ran toward two French police inspectors and declared that he wished to remain in the West. He did not return to the Soviet Union until 1987, when he received a special visa to see his mother, who was ill and near death.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev's first engagement with a Western troupe was in the De Cuevas Ballet's production of "The Sleeping Beauty." He and Mr. Bruhn then formed a small company that gave "divertissement" programs of short ballets and excerpts from longer works. Americans first saw him on television on Jan. 19, 1962, when Mr. Bruhn gave his scheduled performance with Maria Tallchief on the "Bell Telephone Hour" to Mr. Nureyev. He made his New York stage debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on March 10, 1962, dancing the "Don Quixote" pas de deux with Sonia Arova during a performance by the Chicago Opera Ballet. That year, he also appeared briefly with American Ballet Theater in Chicago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev made his British debut on Nov. 2, 1961, when Fonteyn invited him to participate in a charity gala, at which he partnered the American ballerina Rosella Hightower in the "Black Swan" pas de deux (the program mistakenly listed it as "Don Quixote"). He also danced a solo to Scriabin's "Poeme Tragique" that Sir Frederick Ashton had choreographed for him. Mr. Nureyev returned to London on Feb. 21, 1962, as a guest artist with the Royal Ballet. This time, he was cast in "Giselle" and his ballerina was Fonteyn. Ballet history was made and Mr. Nureyev began his long association with the Royal Ballet as a "permanent guest artist" (only British Commonwealth subjects could be full company members at the time). 'Abstract Love' With Fonteyn  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was widely assumed that Fonteyn was approaching the end of her performing career, but it was just as obvious that her new partner had revitalized her. Mr. Nureyev said of Fonteyn in 1965: "I don't care if Margot is a Dame of the British Empire or older than myself. For me she represents eternal youth; there is an absolute musical quality in her beautiful body and phrasing. Because we are sincere and gifted, an intense abstract love is born between us every time we dance together."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Not content with the classics alone at the Royal Ballet, Mr. Nureyev danced in such contemporary ballets as Kenneth MacMillan's "Romeo and Juliet," Roland Petit's "Pelleas et Melisande," Jerome Robbins's "Dances at a Gathering" and George Balanchine's "Apollo."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also restaged many 19th-century classics, beginning with the "Kingdom of the Shades" scene from "La Bayadere" for the Royal Ballet in 1963. Many of these versions emphasized the male dancer as well as the ballerina. Some were unconventional: his "Nutcracker" for the Royal Ballet in 1968 became a Freudian fantasy in which Clara, the child-heroine, is attacked by malevolent bats who turn out to be members of her own family. In his 1986 production of "Swan Lake" for the Paris Opera Ballet, Mr. Nureyev set the action in a room, as a projection of the hero's mind. Mr. Nureyev's more extreme emendations of the classics received mixed notices, as did some of his original ballets, among them "Tancredi" and "Manfred."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unwilling to confine himself to a single troupe, Mr. Nureyev became a globe-trotting guest artist. "I really have to dance more often," he said in 1970, "and so I travel around. If I don't, I will crumble." Unsuccessful Effort To Exorcise Princes  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early in his career in the West, he also expressed a desire to work with George Balanchine, a co-founder of the New York City Ballet. But as Mr. Nureyev recalled in 1979, Balanchine told him: "My ballets are too dry for you. Go and dance your princes. When you're tired of them, come back." Mr. Nureyev commented: "I tried to exorcise those princes out of my system. But they wouldn't go away."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nevertheless, in 1979 Balanchine cast him in a new version of "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme" for the New York City Opera. The other dancers were from the City Ballet but it was not a production of that company, and it was only after Balanchine's death in 1983 that Mr. Nureyev appeared with City Ballet, in 1988, in Balanchine's "Orpheus."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even as he was creating a sensation in the classical repertory, Mr. Nureyev was drawn to modern dance. He tried out a blend of modern and classical technique in 1970 in the Royal Ballet's production of "The Ropes of Time," by Rudi Van Dantzig, then appeared in Glen Tetley's' "Field Figures," "Laborintus" and "Pierrot Lunaire." Mr. Nureyev first danced "The Moor's Pavane" by Jose Limon with the National Ballet of Canada in 1972. That year he began to dance with modern-dance groups as a guest artist, appearing with the Paul Taylor Dance Company, in which his repertory ranged from the lyrical "Aureole" to the comic "Book of Beasts" and then with the Murray Louis Dance Company, in which he performed "Moments" and "Vivace," both created for him by Mr. Louis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev repeatedly appeared with the Martha Graham Dance Company. In 1975 he and Fonteyn starred in "Lucifer," a premiere by Graham, and in subsequent seasons he was seen in several Graham works, including, in 1987, "Appalachian Spring," when the cast included another Kirov defector and guest artist from the ballet world, Mikhail Baryshnikov.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1975 Mr. Nureyev set out on a tour with a small group called Nureyev and Friends, offering classical excerpts and contemporary works. Many similar worldwide tours followed. Kept Paris Ballet At High Level  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev directed the Paris Opera Ballet from 1983 to 1989. Although his opponents charged that he was too often away from Paris performing, he kept the company at a high level of excellence. His own choreography for the company included an adaptation of Henry James's "Washington Square" and a "Cinderella" set in Hollywood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev also made forays into movies, theater and music. His film debut came in 1977 when he played the title role in Ken Russell's "Valentino," and he appeared with Nastassja Kinski in 1983 in the poorly received "Exposed," a film in which he played a violinist seeking vengeance against a <b>terrorist</b>. In 1983 he toured America as the King of Siam in a revival of the musical "The King and I." Shortly afterward, he studied conducting with a tutor and began conducting in Eastern Europe in 1991 and, in 1992, in Russia. Although he was already quite ill, he conducted a single performance of "Romeo and Juliet" for Ballet Theater in New York on May 6, 1992, at the Metropolitan Opera House.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Oct. 8, in his last appearance on stage, to take a bow at the conclusion of the Paris premiere of his new production of "La Bayadere," he looked gaunt and had to be helped to walk. He blinked back tears as the audience gave him a 10-minute standing ovation, after which he was decorated as a Commander of Arts and Letters by France's Minister of Culture and Education, Jack Lang.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A memorial service for Mr. Nureyev is to be held at the Paris Opera on Tuesday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Offstage, Mr. Nureyev was very much a night person who relished parties and discos, and was seen often in the company of prominent socialites. Nevertheless, he managed to keep details of his private life private. As he said in an interview in 1970: "Of course I have a personal life. Something goes on, I'm sure. But I don't think the public should know about that. Do you?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Nureyev: An Autobiography" was published by London, Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 1962.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The superstar's temperamental outbursts were a famous aspect of his career and personality. He walked offstage while partnering Merle Park of the Royal Ballet during a performance at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1970. In 1973, Natalia Makarova publicly accused him of deliberately dropping her onstage in Paris. Incidents in which Mr. Nureyev slapped his partners were widely reported, and in 1991, a male dancer sued him for injuring him in rehearsal in Italy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same year, The Observer in London called him bitter and arrogant. Increasingly, he seemed to be under the strain of refusing to acknowledge that his dancing days were over. And the anti-Semitic remarks he had long made in private (he always referred to Mr. Baryshnikov, who is not Jewish, as Moishe) surfaced in print. Without being named, a Soviet critic in Leningrad was called a "Yiddish bitch" by him in Esquire magazine after her mixed review of his performance at the Kirov in Leningrad in 1989 (the first since his defection). Made Difficulties Obvious to Audience  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Nureyev developed, by his own account, a calculated style as a performer. He made dancing "look difficult and conquerable," as Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The New York Times in 1975, when she commented on how "Mr. Nureyev would make heroic, elaborate preparations for certain steps; the tension increased and so did the thrill for the audience as the difficulty was surmounted."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after the late 1970's, it was increasingly charged that Mr. Nureyev failed to surmount difficulties and that he was dancing past his prime. The phenomenon who once elicited frenzied ovations now provoked discontent. In April 1991, some spectators at a performance by Nureyev and Friends in Sunderland, England, demanded their money back. But Mr. Nureyev refused to announce his retirement. As he said in 1990, "The main thing is dancing, and before it withers away from my body, I will keep dancing till the last moment, the last drop."  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ON a rainy winter afternoon, the writer Sandra Cisneros stands before a ragtag group of children and adults in the tiny Brownsville branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, and with orange and black cat-eyed glasses perched atop her head, begins her song of life in the barrio.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One hand clutches her open book. The other moves passionately, as does her face, which she scrunches into a knot and then opens with delight as she reads aloud of wise children and foolish adults, of tangled Latino and American cultures, of noise and silence and Proustian moments, of intense love and intense anger.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then she passes around her fifth-grade report card.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I have C's and D's in everything," she says, her dark eyes flashing in both disbelief and defiance. "The only B I had was in conduct. But I don't remember being that stupid."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teachers, she explains to the students who strain to see the yellow card, just did not understand what to do with a working-class Mexican-American girl from the South Side of Chicago. "They thought I was a dreamer," the petite, sylphlike woman says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In some ways, she still is a dreamer. But after two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, and with a six-figure publishing contract from Turtle Bay Books, a division of Random House, this 38-year-old poet and short-story writer now has few questioning her abilities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cited by critics as an important new author with a vigorous and original voice, Ms. Cisneros is one of only a handful of Latina writers to make it big on the American scene, along with the likes of Julia Alvarez, a Dominican-American, and Cristina Garcia, a Cuban-American. In 1991, she won praise for "Woman Hollering Creek," (Vintage Books) a collection of short stories and sketches that survey the condition of women.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, Turtle Bay published a hardcover version of a collection of poems, "My Wicked Wicked Ways," first published in paperback in 1987 by Third Woman Press. Its first printing of more than 5,000 sold out, the book is in its second printing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her works are filled with young girls coming of age, dejected brides and powerful, passionate women. In "You Bring Out the Mexican in Me," part of a new collection of poetry, "Loose Woman," that Ms. Cisneros is working on, she writes:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">You bring out the Dolores del Rio in me.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Mexican spitfire in me.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The raw navajas, glint and passion in me .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And just as the report card seems an odd mirror for one whose writings have made their way into hundreds of curriculums and more than a dozen anthologies, Ms. Cisneros, who can be both fiercely feminine and androgynous, idealistic and deeply cynical, is herself a study in contradiction. Before her audience at the library, which she visited as part of a three-city tour promoting "My Wicked Wicked Ways," she cuts a sophisticated figure in a long, sleek crushed velvet outfit, boots and short dark hair. But her expressions are whimsical, her voice small and childlike.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her writing is lean. Her conversation style is chatty and rambling. Though she speaks with passion about her collection of boyfriends, she lives alone as "nobody's mother and nobody's wife." She is a self-described "<b>terrorist</b>," "anarchist" and "Chicana feminist," though in the same breath she says she knows little about "-ists or -isms."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am a woman and I am a Latina," she says over a plate of pancakes and bacon the next morning at Good Enough to Eat, on the Upper West Side, lacing her sentences with Spanish words that roll over her tongue. Her voice is deeper when she speaks Spanish. "Those are the things that make my writing distinctive. Those are the things that give my writing power. They are the things that give it sabor, the things that give it picante."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is finding the middle ground between the Latin and the American that has provided the most creative tension for Ms. Cisneros. The first resolution of such tension, she says, was making it through school. The second was moving away from home and her Mexican father, Mexican-American mother and six brothers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My father always defined my gender to my brothers," she says. "He'd say, 'This is your sister, you must take care of her.' "  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After graduating from Loyola University of Chicago, she went to the Iowa Writers Workshop. She then returned to Chicago but decided to live alone. Her father, an upholsterer, continued to ask her to come back home and "stop all the foolishness." Self-doubt began to hang over her.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working as a teacher of high-school dropouts, then as a college recruiter, she wrote at her kitchen table at night, fighting bouts of loneliness and anxiety. She would stare at a Mary Cassatt calendar that pictured white women and children and had the quotation, "I can live alone and I love to work." She says: "It became a mantra to me. I was trying to live alone, like all of these women in the calendar, and I was trying to work. But it's hard if you are a Mexican woman and used to living with your family and not estranging them. It was like being a traitor to your country.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But you didn't know, were you a traitor? Were you being corrupted by all of these American ways? Had you really been ruined by college as your father said? Had you forsaken everything you were and pretended to be something you weren't? There was a lot of doubt."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But she knew something her colleagues at Iowa didn't. She could write about growing up as a shy Latina who moved back and forth from Mexico to Chicago, from house to house and school to school.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The house on Mango Street is ours," she writes in her book "The House on Mango Street" (Vintage, 1989), "and we don't have to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Pausing over her breakfast, she says: "I always felt that we were victims of a fairy tale, that somehow some spell had happened. I thought it was just temporary hard times."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those hard times have made her success seem so sweet. "Every time someone asks me to sign a book, I feel like laughing," she says. "It's so wacky. I was the girl with the C's and D's. I was the girl in the corner with the goofy glasses from Sears. I was the ugly kid in the class with the bad haircut, the one nobody would talk to. I was the one that never got picked to be in the play."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Having spent most of her adult life living hand to mouth ("I once put back a light bulb at the grocery," she says, "because I thought I could move the bulbs to rooms where I needed them"), Ms. Cisneros says the publishing contracts have allowed her to buy a new Victorian house in San Antonio, where she has lived off and on since 1984. Unlike Chicago, where her family still lives, San Antonio allows her to straddle the Mexican-American border and culture.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But those early hard times have also served to forge a clear political agenda for Ms. Cisneros, who has refused to appear in ads for the Gap or to allow her work in anthologies that use the word "Hispanic."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">" 'Hispanic' is English for a person of Latino origin who wants to be accepted by the white status quo," she says. "Latino is the word we have always used for ourselves."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says she refused to pose for an Annie Leibovitz Gap ad last year because the clothing company does not have a strong enough commitment to Latino communities. (Officials at the Gap headquarters in San Francisco were not available yesterday to comment on her statement, a company spokeswoman said.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She champions the working class and insists that other Latino writers be included in collections. "This is something I always come back to," she says. "I tell students, you really should not be glad that I'm the only Latina that's getting published. You should be ashamed. Why am I the only one? Its a question that we have to ask. It's absurd.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't want young people in the barrios to see me as a kind of an example of pull yourselves up by the bootstrap. That's the last thing I want. I really want them to question the educational system and the whole system that is created to keep them from becoming what I became. I'm the exception not the rule."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, besides working on "Loose Woman" and a novel, "Caramelo," Ms. Cisneros says she serves as an informal spokeswoman for Latinos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't have to dream anymore about how to give insulin shots or how to give out condoms from planes," she says. "I can do my <b>terrorist</b> activities now by staying home and writing. I have the power to make people think in a different way. It's a different way of defining power, and it is something that I don't want to abuse or lose. I want to help my community.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm a translator. I'm an amphibian. I can travel in both worlds. What I'm saying is very important for the Latino community, but it is also important for the white community to hear. What I'm saying in my writing is that we can be Latino and still be American."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photos: Sandra Cisneros said that through her writing she is a "translator" and an informal spokeswoman for Latinos. (pg. C1); For an audience at a Brooklyn library, Sandra Cisneros reads from her work and tells of her road to literary success. (C.M. Hardt for The New York Times) (pg. C10)  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blind Muslim cleric now preaching in Brooklyn and New Jersey, who stood trial in Egypt a decade ago for the assassination of President Anwar el-Sadat, is emerging as the spiritual leader of an Islamic fundamentalist movement that has carried out a series of violent attacks that has shaken the Egyptian Government.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, living in self-imposed exile in the United States following his acquittal, is a voice heard not only in the mosques that run along Atlantic Avenue, where Yemeni, Sudanese and Egyptian immigrants worship, but on tens of thousands of scratchy cassette tapes that are sold in the back alleys and hallways of Cairo's schools and universities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheik's message, which includes calls to eradicate anyone who stands in the way of Islam, has begun to rattle not only the Egyptian Government, but also United States officials, who are now seeking to deport him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.B.I. is also investigating the cleric in connection with three slayings in the United States, and Egyptian authorities contend that he is behind dozens of violent attacks in Egypt, including a spate of shootings against foreign tourists. A Spiritual Mentor  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheik's calls for violence has suddenly gained prominence with the marked increase in attacks in Egypt by Muslim militants on Coptic Christians, foreign tourists and Egyptian Government officials. The 54-year-old Sheik is the spiritual mentor to legions of young Egyptians, who find in his fiery, uncompromising vision a promise to sweep away the "corrupt" rule of President Hosni Mubarak and replace it with a pure Islamic state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Islam has roots in Egypt and the country's future belongs to the Islamists," the Sheik said in one message broadcast recently over the Lebanese radio station of the Iranian-backed Party of God. He warned that President Hosni Mubarak's fate will match that of his predecessor Mr. Sadat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Egyptian regime is fighting Islam," the Sheik declared in the radio broadcast, "Spreading vice and immorality, and trying to eradicate Islamic values in the country."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian cleric who fostered a revolution against Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi from exile in Paris, the Sheik's sermons are duplicated on tapes and smuggled back home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman uses New York as a base," said Mamdouh Beltagui, the director of the Egyptian state information service. "He raises funds and sends money back to Egypt with couriers. He passes on messages to his followers, giving orders about what they should do next and who they should target. We do not understand why the U.S. authorities have allowed him to enter the country." Arrived on Tourist Visa  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The State Department contends that the Sheik, who is on an official United States <b>terrorist</b> list, slipped into the country from Khartoum, Sudan, in May 1990 on a tourist visa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States immigration officials revoked the Sheik's green card in March and he is appealing the decision at the hearing scheduled for Jan. 20. He is charged with misrepresenting himself on his visa application, polygamy and "crimes of moral turpitude," according to Immigration and Naturalization Service offcials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Sheik, who once taught theology at Asyut University, now lives in Jersey City. He has three wives, two of whom live in Cairo with their six children. His third wife is an American convert to Islam, whom he married shortly after his arrival here.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">United States officials in Cairo contend that the Egyptian Government does not want the Sheik, who was one of two defendants aquitted in the 1982 trial of more than a score of Muslim fundamentalists for the assasination of Mr. Sadat, to return to Egypt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Egyptian Government, for all the noise it makes, does not want him here and has never wanted him here," one diplomat in Cairo said. "He may get expelled after this hearing, but don't expect him to land in Cairo." Sermons on Tapes  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a back alley in Imbaba, a sprawling Cairo slum that is a stronghold of Islamic fundamentalism, a young man in a white robe and skullcap sat before an array of books and cassette tapes, many of them sermons of the Sheik.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman is one of our guides," he said. "We all listen to his sermons and follow his teachings."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, near the mosque where the Sheik once preached, Ali, a clerk at the Fertile Crescent, a Middle Eastern grocery store, warned that any moves against the cleric would only ehance his stature.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He is the Emir of the Muslim movement," he said. "He could be like Khomeini. Khomeini went to Paris and he came back to overthrow the Shah."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cleric's followers offer unswerving allegiance. "He is like our father," said Montasser al-Zayat, his lawyer and friend. "He speaks the pure truth of Islam and is afraid of no one but God."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teachings of the cleric are stark for their simplicity and their call to violence. The Sheik is fond is issuing fatwas, religious edicts that call for the murder of infidels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But United States and Egyptian authorities say there have been other, less publicized edicts that tie the Sheik, and his followers in Egypt, known as The Islamic Group, to a series of killings both in Egypt and the United States, including the recent attacks against foreign tourists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">El Sayyid Nosair, currently serving seven to 23 years for crimes related to the slaying of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the Israeli right-wing leader, was a frequent worshipper at the Sheik's mosque in Brooklyn. And United States officials contend that the Sheik has made sure that Mr. Nosair, an Egyptian immigrant with an American-born wife, and his family receive financial support until his release.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The F.B.I. is investigating the Sheik for possible involvement in the slaying of Mustafa Shalabi, an Egyptain immigrant who was found murdered in his Brooklyn apartment over a year ago, as well as the slaying of Rabbi Kahane and the killing of a man in Cleveland.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Same River Twice A Memoir By Chris Offutt 188 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $18.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one sense, Chris Offutt's unusual poetic memoir is the story of a man contemplating in <b>terror</b> the impending birth of his first child.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the beginning of "The Same River Twice," the author reports how he reluctantly gave in to his wife's desire to conceive a baby before her biological clock ran out. "I'm not afraid of much," he writes, "and it bothered me that I was scared of something as basic as having a child. The subject remained with us, floating like an ovum waiting for a sperm."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, after many visits to the doctor and much temperature-taking, an illicit nighttime dip in a public swimming pool led to a rare session of spontaneous lovemaking. "I felt like Zeus field-testing his swan suit before the seduction of Leda. Gamete met zygote. DNA merged into the corkscrew that resembled the Milky Way's spiral, Hermes' Staff, the swift helix of infant birth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the pregnancy progresses, the couple wait in a small rented house by the Iowa River, where the author has moved to attend the University of Iowa writing program. In alternate chapters, he describes the present and the past. In the present, he often wanders along the river, seeing in the violence of nature a metaphor for the risk of birth. In a typical incident that he observes, a kingfisher tries to catch a bluegill and drowns after accidentally stabbing the palate of a larger fish that is simultaneously attacking the bluegill. "Routine activity betrayed the kingfisher, just as pregnancy is a breach of sex," the author writes. "I understand the bird's disbelief. I would trade my imagination for its wings."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is Mr. Offutt's memories of his squandered past that lend the book its bizarre, sometimes disturbing flavor. "While the rest of my generation had been lodging themselves into careers, I'd pretty much run amok," he recalls. Starting out from his Kentucky home in the foothills of southern Appalachia -- "My hometown is a ZIP code with a creek" -- he had traveled to the far corners of America and lived through "a sequence of halfhearted attempts at self-destruction."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In New York City, he had tried to become an actor while dating a madcap woman named Jahi who enjoyed creating public spectacles. Once she stole a ream of paper and opened the bundle on a windy sidewalk. "Oh my God!" she shrieked. "My manuscript!" In West Texas, he worked as a house painter for Bill, a Vietnam veteran who could match the exhilaration of combat only by skydiving. Soon after accompanying him on a terrifying jump, the author learned that Bill had drunk a pint of kerosene and "Zippoed his mouth -- reversing the favored method of Vietnamese monks protesting the war." He reports, "There was no note."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the memoir's most arresting episode, Mr. Offutt recalls how he joined a circus in Alabama and eventually rose to dressing up as a walrus in a performing-animal act. He found the circus folk to be a rigidly stratified society, at the top of which was the Parrot Lady, so named for body tattoos she revealed in a striptease act that culminated with her sliding a lighted fluorescent tube down her throat. "The spotlight went black. Her body glowed from within, illuminating the birds in an ethereal, ghostly light, like a jungle dawn." The author's circus career ended when the Parrot Lady invited him into her trailer to tell him her tragic secrets and fed him so many martinis that he later got sick and had to remove his walrus head in the middle of his act.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Does the reader believe the stories Mr. Offutt tells? Not always literally. At times you sense that he is embroidering his memories or, more exactly, enriching the journals he says he kept so conscientiously while training himself to become a writer that he came to believe "that the journal was my life, and the rest of existence only a fiction." Occasionally troubling, too, is his tendency to strain for effects, as when he writes, "The guts of America unfolded in every direction as I traveled the interstate bloodstream, dodging the white corpuscles of perverts, cops and outlaws."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the <b>terrors</b> of the author's irresponsible past balance neatly the fears of his too-responsible future. Side by side, the two narratives powerfully convey his sense of being trapped. It's tough to choose between running away and becoming a father. Besides, there is nothing in the book so scary as the eventual arrival of the baby, whose birth, in Mr. Offutt's prose, truly recapitulates the creative violence of the nature he describes so intimately.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder he concludes: "Women are stronger, more ruthless in battle. . . . Women invented language through application of sound to meaning. The earliest writings are by women, receipts for the sale of land in what is now Iraq. If childbearing were left to men, our species would have moldered because males could never accommodate the pain. We can barely get through hangovers and football games."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All the same, if Mr. Offutt has it right, there are men who play games and also try to face the pain. They pride themselves on their destructiveness, and then they turn around to face the consequences. For them, life is a river at once tearing down and building up. And despite Heraclitus's insistence that to do so is impossible, Mr. Offutt boldly immerses himself in that same river twice.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Latin Democracy Lives in Rockets' Red Glare" and "Frustrations Blaze a Path For Egypt's Fundamentalists," reports from two distant continents, raise the specter of growing threats and challenges to elected governments (The Week in Review, Dec. 6). In Caracas, Venezuela, you explain a violent military coup attempt as a function of the corruption of a political system dominated by two parties, both authoritarian and narrowly elitist. You offer a similar explanation for the growing power of Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt, where a closed political system has reportedly left radicals with few alternatives to <b>terrorist</b> violence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is true that in Venezuela and Egypt, as in much of the world, ostensibly democratic elections mask highly closed systems in which political participation is effectively restricted. However, such an insight fails to analyze adequately the growing power and influence of violent factions within Latin American and North African societies. In each instance, the political system is increasingly viewed by citizens as corrupt and elitist because of government policies that have adversely affected the standard of living.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What we are witnessing in Venezuela and Egypt is the legacy of prolonged economic austerity imposed from without by the International Monetary Fund, acting on behalf of foreign creditors. Numerous studies have shown that I.M.F. stabilization programs lower local living standards, increase unemployment and redistribute wealth and income upward to the benefit of local and foreign elites. Unfortunately, in neither article do you mention a single word about the significance of a decade of such austerity on the Venezuelan or Egyptian body politic.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Entrenched authority will continue to claim that I.M.F.-imposed policies are necessary to future growth and prosperity throughout the third world. While the intricacies of international finance often serve to shield such issues from political debate, increasing numbers of people in the third world have concluded that the I.M.F. experiment has failed their own interests and that a decade of trickle-up economics must end. Any analysis of political chaos must begin and end with the underlying economic causes that drive people to violence. TIMOTHY A. CANOVA Point Lookout, L.I., Dec. 17, 1992 The writer teaches international trade and finance at Hofstra University's New College. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 5 -- After months of debate between the Commerce Department and the Defense Department, an interagency committee reached a tentative agreement today to allow the export of jet engines to the Chinese military, Government officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The interagency group, known as the Policy Coordinating Committee on technology transfers, also considered today whether to allow the sale of 10 crop duster aircraft to Iran and the sale of satellite gear to China. But no progress was made on resolving either issue, said two Government officials who insisted on anonymity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Representatives of the State Department, the Commerce Department and the Defense Department agreed that the engines could be sold provided that their electronic controls are not too advanced, the officials said. The Defense Department must now draw up technical specifications for the electronic controls, and the sale will be approved unless new squabbles come up in the drafting of the specifications. Obstacle to a Deal  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Defense Department has already begun drafting the specifications for the electronic engine controls and was asked by the interagency committee to complete them tonight. The department has led resistance to the sale of the jet engines, and if it produces very restrictive specifications then the approval process could bog down again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Departments of Defense and Commerce "seem to think they can work something out, and it's fine with State," said an Administration official who insisted on anonymity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the sale of the jet engines is likely to prompt renewed complaints from Congress that the Administration is coddling a repressive foreign government.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, also said today that the Administration a month ago rejected the proposed licensing of petrochemical technology for the construction of a petrochemical factory in Iran. The factory's maker, BP America Inc., has enlisted the Commerce Department's support in an unsuccessful effort to win a review of that decision, an American official said today. 2 Committees Involved  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting today did not include the BP America sale, which has been handled by a separate group, the Policy Coordinating Committee on the non-proliferation of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons. A national security directive from President Bush in 1989 created the two policy coordinating committees to handle interagency disputes over export control laws, which restrict the sale of American technology to Communist countries and nations that support <b>terrorism</b>.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The factory was disapproved because its byproducts would have included hydrogen cyanide gas. The gas has little value as a chemical warfare weapon because it is lighter than air and disperses quickly. But the State Department decided to disapprove the sale anyway because it might inaccurately signal a new leniency toward Iran, and because of popular fears in the United States of any chemical compound that includes cyanide, an Administration official said on Monday afternoon.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAIRO, Jan. 5 -- Suspected Muslim militants fired shots at a bus carrying Japanese visitors in southern Egypt today, extending attacks that have dealt a heavy blow to the nation's $3 billion tourist industry, its most important source of revenue.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Authorities said none of the 20 Japanese aboard the bus were hurt. The Japanese were being driven back to Cairo from Luxor, the location of majestic Pharaonic temples and tombs, when their bus was sprayed with bullets, which the police said missed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incident, in the city of Asyut, evoked memories of the killing of a British tourist there in a similar attack in October. Since 1981, this region along the Nile has been a fundamentalist stronghold and the site of frequent clashes as the fundamentalists attacked Coptic Christians, who make up about one-fifth of the population.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By some estimates, up to 60 percent of tourist reservations have been canceled nationwide, and luxury hotels here in Cairo, which are usually filled on Christmas and New Year's, suffered badly this season.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The violence resumed on Sunday and Monday with attacks on the Coptic Christian minority. The attacks, in which one person was killed and a second hurt, are interpreted here as a signal of defiance against President Hosni Mubarak, whose police forces cracked down extensively on the fundamentalists early last month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A leading militant figure who asked not to be identified by name said in an interview tonight that the attacks would not stop until the authorities released thousands of fundamentalists rounded up in the last few months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Muslim militants' region-wide challenge is the subject of a three-day meeting in Tunis of 17 Arab interior ministers, which began on Monday. It is looking into ways of cooperating, including the exchange of information, to combat the fundamentalists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Those attending include the Interior Ministers of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Tunisia, Algeria and Tunisia, all of which engaged in struggles of varying degrees against Muslim militants seeking to gain a share of power by force or <b>terrorism</b>.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egypt's Interior Minister, Abdel Halim Moussa, told the gathering today, "We are all in the same boat and we will be threatened by this danger sooner or later." His statement was a reminder to countries like Saudi Arabia that until recently were known to give financial aid to the fundamentalists.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BEIJING, Jan. 5 -- Newly disclosed confidential government documents suggest that the Cultural Revolution plumbed previously unreported depths of savagery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents, prepared by local government offices in the 1980's, two decades after the events they describe, seem to offer a meticulous record of how Red Guards and Communist officials in one province not only tortured their victims to death but also ate their flesh.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Copies of the documents have been smuggled out of China by Zheng Yi, a prominent writer wanted by the Chinese authorities for his work for the democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in 1989. After three and a half years as a fugitive, Mr. Zheng is to arrive in New York on Wednesday. Some Ugly Details  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At some high schools, students killed their principals in the school courtyard and then cooked and ate the bodies to celebrate a triumph over "counterrevolutionaries," the documents report. Government-run cafeterias are said to have displayed bodies dangling on meat hooks and to have served human flesh to employees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many varieties of cannibalism," declares one report, "and among them are these: killing someone and making a late dinner of it, slicing off the meat and having a big party, dividing up the flesh so each person takes a large chunk home to boil, roasting the liver and eating it for its medicinal properties, and so on."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents suggest that at least 137 people, and probably hundreds more, were eaten in Guangxi Province in southern China in the late 1960's. In most cases, many people ate the flesh of one corpse, so the number of cannibals may have numbered in the thousands. Found Only in One Province  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cannibalism described in the documents was apparently confined to parts of Guangxi Province, a relatively remote area, and was subsequently kept quiet. There is no evidence that anyone in the national Communist Party leadership endorsed it or even knew of it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents are stamped with official seals, and there is no indication of any tampering. A spokesman for the Guangxi Region Foreign Affairs Office said he could not comment on whether there had been cannibalism and could not allow a reporter to visit the area and investigate directly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The incidents reported from Guangxi were apparently the most extensive episodes of cannibalism in the world in the last century or more. They were also different from any others in that those who took part were not motivated by hunger or psychopathic illness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, the actions appeared to be ideological: the cannibalism, which the documents say took place in public, was often organized by local Communist Party officials, and people apparently took part together to prove their revolutionary ardor. A Proof of Loyalty  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an interview after he left China and was waiting for his United States visa, Mr. Zheng cited one example from his own research in Guangxi: the first person to strip meat from the body of one school principal was the former girlfriend of the man's son; she wanted to show that she had no sympathy for him and was just as "red" as anybody else.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are the most gruesome and shocking revelations to date on the Cultural Revolution," said Robin Munro, an Asia Watch specialist on China and one of the few people who have examined the documents. "This evidence reveals horrors from the Cultural Revolution that rival in character if not in scope the worst excesses of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Zheng said he secretly photographed the documents on trips to Guangxi Province in 1986 and 1988, using a false letter of introduction to win cooperation from the authorities. An Accent on <b>Terror</b>  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even by the standards of the period, the reported horrors extend into previously unknown territory. Mr. Zheng cites an example from the documents of a woman who was forced to identify and denounce the mutilated corpse of her husband, who had been killed, stripped of his flesh and mostly eaten. As punishment for having loved a "counterrevolutionary," she was forced to sleep with his head beside her.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of those reportedly involved in the cannibalism received minor punishments when the Cultural Revolution ended after Mao's death in 1976. Wuxuan County expelled 91 people from the Communist Party for having eaten human flesh, and it demoted or cut the wages of 39 non-members of the party, but apparently no one faced criminal prosecution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Map of China, indicating Guangxi. Chart: "A Grim Chronicle" Translated from a document that Zheng Yi, a dissident and writer, said was prepared by local Chinese government offices. Mr. Zheng has smuggled copies of several such documents out of China. 'The Diverser Varieties of Cannibalism' "There are many varieties of cannablism, and among them are these: killing someone and making a late dinner of it, slicing off the meat and having a big party, dividing up the flesh so each person takes a large chunk home to boil, roasting the liver and eating it for its medicinal properties, and so on."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WEST POINT, N.Y., Jan. 5 -- Following are excerpts from President Bush's address to West Point cadets:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Let me begin with the hard part. It is difficult for a Navy person to come up to West Point after that game a month ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I watched it. Amazing things can happen in sports. Look at the Oilers, my other team, that took it on the chin the other day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I guess the morale of -- moral of all this is that losing is never easy -- trust me -- I know something about that. But if you -- if you have to lose, that's the way to do it. Fight with all you have, give it your best shot, and win or lose, learn from it and get on with life. And I'm about to get on with the rest of my life.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But before I do, I want to share with you at this institution of leadership some of my thinking, both about the world you will soon be called upon to enter, and the life that you've chosen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any President has several functions. He speaks for and to the nation. He must faithfully execute the law, and he must lead. But no function, none of the President's hats, in my view, is more important than his role as Commander in Chief. For it is as Commander in Chief that the President confronts and makes decisions that, one way or another, affects the lives of everyone in this country as well as many others around the world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And I've had many occasions to don this most important of hats, and over the past four years, the men and women who proudly and bravely wear the uniforms of the U.S. armed services, have been called upon to go in harm's way, and have discharged their duty with honor and professionalism. Time of Great Promise  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I wish I could say that such demands were a thing of the past, that with the end of the cold war, the calls upon the United States would diminish. I cannot. Yes, the end of the cold war, we would all concede, is a blessing. It is a time of great promise. Democratic governments have never been so numerous. What happened two or three days ago in Moscow would not have been possible in the cold-war days.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to historic treaties such as that Start II pact just reached with Russia, the likelihood of nuclear holocaust is vastly diminished. But this does not mean that there is no specter of war, no threats to be reckoned with, and already we see disturbing signs of what this new world could become if we are passive and aloof.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We would risk the emergence of a world characterized by violence, characterized by chaos, one in which dictators and tyrants threaten their neighbors, build arsenals brimming with weapons of mass destruction, and ignore the welfare of their own men, women and children. And we could see a horrible increase in international <b>terrorism</b>, with American citizens more at risk than ever before. . . .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two hundred years ago, another departing President warned of the dangers of what he described as "entangling alliances." His was the right course for a new nation at that point in history. But what was entangling in Washington's day is now essential.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And this is why at Texas A&amp;M a few weeks ago, I spoke of the folly of isolationism and of the importance, morally, economically and strategically of the United States remaining involved in world affairs. We must engage ourselves if a new world order, one more compatible with our values and congenial to our interests, is to emerge. But even more, we must lead. When U.S. Should Act  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leadership: well, it takes many forms. It can be political or diplomatic, it can be economic or military, it can be moral or spiritual leadership. Leadership can take any one of these forms or it can be a combination of them. Leadership should not be confused with either unilateralism or universalism. We need not respond by ourselves to each and every outrage of violence. The fact that America can act does not mean that it must. . . .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometimes, sometimes the decision not to use force, to stay our hand, I can tell you it's just as difficult as a decision to send our soldiers into battle. The former Yugoslavia, well, it's been such a situation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are, we all know, important humanitarian and strategic interests at stake there, but up to now it's not been clear that the application of limited amounts of force by the United States and its traditional friends and allies would have had the desired effect, given the nature and the complexity of that situation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Our assessment of the situation in the former Yugoslavia could well change if and as the situation changes. The stakes could grow. The conflict could threaten to spread. Indeed, we are constantly reassessing our options and are actively consulting with others about steps that might be taken to contain the fighting, protect the humanitarian effort and deny Serbia the fruits of aggression.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Military force is never a tool to be used lightly, or universally. In some circumstances it may be essential. In others, counterproductive. I know that many people would like to find some formula, some easy formula to apply, to tell us with precision when and where to intervene with force. . . . Criteria for Force  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But to warn against a futile quest for a set of hard and fast rules to govern the use of military force is not to say there cannot be some principles to inform our decisions. Such guidelines can prove useful in sizing and indeed shaping our forces, and in helping us to think our way through this key question.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using military force makes sense as a policy where the stakes warrant, where and when force can be effective, where no other policies are likely to prove effective, where its application can be limited in scope and time, and where the potential benefits justify the potential costs and sacrifice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once we are satisfied that force makes sense, we must act with the maximum possible support. The United States can and should lead, but we will want to act in concert, where possible, involving the United Nations or other multinational grouping. . . .  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in every case involving the use of force, it will be essential to have a clear and achievable mission, a realistic plan for accomplishing the mission, and criteria no less realistic for withdrawing U.S. forces once the mission is complete.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only if we keep these principles in mind will the potential sacrifice be one that can be explained and justified.  </p>

<p></p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jan. 5 -- They lay bundled up in blankets on the bathroom floor as they had died, 10 old people thin as matchsticks. Each of them remained in their stockinged feet and sweaters and woolen hats, as though the freezing cold that was their final enemy might pursue them beyond the grave.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the morning that the people of Sarajevo marked the beginning of their 10th month under siege, 10 of the 118 residents of an unheated home for the elderly on the outskirts of the city had died in two days. The dead included three men and seven women and their deaths brought to 190 the number of residents who lived at the home when the siege began who are now dead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one of the dormitories, another old woman, her face swollen by infection and her hands and feet blackening from frostbite, was living painfully through her last hours huddling in a blanket.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside in the snow it was a point above zero, so cold that dogs and cats scavenging for food among the discarded plastic packs of American military rations scampered for the indoors each time somebody opened the home's only useable entrance, on the side away from the snipers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Without post-mortems or a doctor to certify the cause of death before the bodies were taken away for quick burials at a cemetery 10 miles north of the city, the conditions left no doubt, to the nursing staff or anybody else, that the old people, mostly in their 70's and 80's, were victims of the siege. They died because the siege has deprived Sarajevo of electricity, and thus the power for the boilers that furnish the home with heating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As French soldiers from the United Nations military force began loading the bodies onto an army truck this morning to carry them away, they rolled each bundle gently off a stretcher onto the truck, and the bodies were arrayed side by side.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There was nothing to quiet the sense that the ultimate nightmare of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina had begun. For here, less than half a mile from the United Nations forces' headquarters, was evidence that people in this devastated republic are dying not only from the heavy artillery bombardments and daily <b>terror</b> of the civil war, but from the winter cold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If it is so, and nobody can know what is happening in vast regions of the republic that are cut off by the war, what happened at the Dom Penzionera in Nedjarici, the home for the elderly, may come to be seen in time as the moment when the western world was confronted with evidence that its efforts to save at least something from the catastrophe of Bosnia had failed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since the summer, officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have been warning, from their Geneva headquarters, that as many as 400,000 Bosnians could die during the winter from a combination of hunger and cold.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today, one of those officials, Jose-Maria Mendiluce, a 41-year-old Spaniard charged with overseeing all United Nations relief efforts throughout the former Yugoslavia, talked as if he, at least, no longer doubted that those warnings could come true.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The events at the home were explained to Mr. Mendiluce as he arrived for one of his regular visits here aboard one of the western military aircraft that fly relief supplies into Sarajevo airport. He hinted to reporters that he was on the verge of breaking with the consensus that has governed United Nations activities here, that the Bosnian problem can be best dealt with by negotiation, not by western military intervention.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know of many other places like this," he said, referring to the deaths at the home and reports, mostly unconfirmed, that people are beginning to die in large numbers of the cold in the Bosnian hinterland. Airlift of Stoves  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mendiluce had just issued orders radically altering the approach the United Nations has been taking until now in its effort to keep Sarajevo's 380,000 people from succumbing to winter. Effective immediately, he said, the military airlift, about 20 heavy transport planes a day, will carry no more food, only sleeping bags and blankets and stoves, and overland transports will shift to carrying as much wood and coal as they can.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crisis at the home for the elderly is only a symptom of the city's wider plight. With temperatures now hovering near zero, and with no electricity and virtually no natural gas, families spend days hunting for wood. Many of the city's parks and sidewalks have already been stripped of trees.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Knots of people, often women and children, cluster along roadways chopping at stumps with axes, sometimes even with penknives. Others wait nearby, eager to scrape the last chips off the frozen earth into plastic bags.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The situation has become so desperate that two men were sawing a tree at midnight earlier this week at one of the most dangerous intersections in the city, directly under sniper positions of the Serbian nationalist forces besieging the city. Asked why they took the risk, the men shrugged. "It's the only tree the others didn't dare take," one said. Burning Books and Furniture  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other families have been feeding books into their wood-burning stoves, or breaking up furniture. Virtually everybody sleeps fully clothed, in overcoats, sometimes even in boots.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Conditions at the home for the elderly have been atrocious for months. The home sits in a corner of one of the most ferociously contested battlefields of the siege, a Serbian-held salient close to the airport.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Seventeen of the residents who have died have been hit by mortar or sniper fire, while others survived for months, until the fall, with barely anything to eat. Since the only doctor quit, early in the siege, there has been only one nurse to provide medical care.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the bodies of the latest victims were being carried away today, only 12 residents, out of 108 who remain alive, were out of bed, and they were gathered in the only common room with a wood-burning stove. Their resolute good cheer brought applause for a visitor who emptied his pockets to find two chocolate bars and two oranges. Faces Under Blankets  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scores of residents lay inert in unheated dormitories, blankets over their heads. The few whose faces could be seen stared back blankly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The six staff members who remain spent much of their day preparing and delivering a thin stew of bony meat and cabbage for lunch, and tackling shocking sanitary conditions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no water or electricity for laundry, the staff strip the sheets from the beds, sometimes scraping away feces, and place the sheets back on the beds. Many of the sheets returned to the beds were soaked in urine. The odor was overpowering.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A week ago, after seven residents died in five days, a United Nations social worker visited the home and took a list of urgently needed items, including wood-burning stoves for the dormitories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first consignment of stoves arrived this morning, on the truck that carried the 10 bodies to the graveyard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Mendiluce said he had ordered an inquiry, and would announce the results within 24 hours. In any case, he said, deaths like those at the home were the fault not of the United Nations relief effort, but of the refusal of the warring sides to agree on a peace settlement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is not a just solution," he said, "no free access to the city, no free access to heating fuel, no normal supplies to guarantee the life of Sarajevo, people will die."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Photo: An elderly man grieved in Sarajevo as the body of his wife was bound in a blanket.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOGADISHU, Somalia, Jan. 4 -- Bashir Aynab Ali got his first assault rifle two years ago, when a relative handed him a stolen AK-47 to join the revolt against President Mohammed Siad Barre.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was his rite of passage into Somalia's world of the gunman, a treacherous universe of Robin Hood-style thieves of some honor, murderers with no honor, and survival by the barrel of the gun. For the 22-year-old, the gun turned out to be more useful than a baccalaureate.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Somalia descended into anarchy, Mr. Ali's AK-47 guaranteed him employment in one of the country's few growth businesses -- hired bodyguard work. It gave him the power to get food during a famine. And it was a negotiable currency, one that could be exchanged for regular money for life's essentials. Means of Survival  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I took the gun to save my life," said the slender young man with a scar across his face from a fight. "I took it to survive, for any circumstance I would meet."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Somalia's guns came with the cold war -- aid for President Siad Barre, first from the Soviet Union, then from the United States. When Mr. Siad Barre fell, Government garrisons were overrun, the weapons becoming the looted property of the people.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before American troops landed here, nine types of artillery pieces were said to be in common use in Mogadishu -- one French, three American and five Soviet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gun culture is pervasive, with AK-47's fired into the air in celebration after weddings. Private homes have their own heavy weapons. On the streets, pitifully thin urchins sit in the dirt playing with empty shiny brass AK-47 shells as toys.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the Americans arrived more than three weeks ago, many Somalis expected disarmament to be a top priority. Prices for assault rifles fell almost overnight from $150 to $50. Now, with the United States military insisting that its mission is to deliver food, many here seem to be virtually demanding that the Americans save Somalis from themselves.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think if they are not going to disarm, they should go back home," said Abdu Baffo, an agronomist working with the British branch of Save the Children. "Why did we need the intervention? Because we were unable to sit down and sort out factors by ourselves, and arms are the reason we couldn't do so."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the surface, conditions look safer. The jeeps armed with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers have disappeared from the streets under agreements between warlords negotiated by United States officials. And the market where grenades and ammunition was as prevalent as food has pretty much evaporated in the last few days. Just a Change of Venue  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Somalis say the looters in the capital have simply moved off the thoroughfares traveled by American troops and into other neighborhoods, where they <b>terrorize</b> local residents.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many people also admit that they are hiding their weapons at home or under blankets in their cars.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it still seems as if almost every man and boy owns at least one assault rifle -- people like 16-year-old Assad Abdi Mohammed, whose teeth are stained brown from chewing khat, or Mohammed Jailani, a health official who bought two automatic rifles to defend his home from looters, or Ujer Ali Sheik, a onetime Government clerk who admits that he used to watch for food deliveries and then raid the warehouses, using his rifle as persuasion.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If there is food I must take it because nobody will ever give it to me," said the 28-year-old father of four, whose face is drawn, aged beyond his years. "I must save my children. When it comes, they will not give it out in a regular way, so you must get it by force." Job Creation  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a world hostage to guns, even the gunmen dream of deliverance. Young Assad cradles his weapon in his sarong and talks of selling it to the Americans for $500, a fivefold markup over its original purchase price. He reasons that he would then have enough cash to go into business as a money changer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Ali says he is ready to give his weapon without payment, though disarmament is clearly a chancy proposition for him in a country where unemployment is the norm. Since he turned 20, he has spent what he had hoped would be his university years surviving by the gun.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In January 1991, as part of a group that stormed an arsenal, Mr. Ali seized 40 weapons, most AK-47's and M-16's, and sold the bulk of them at handsome prices. When food became scarce, he turned to his gun once again.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are looters who would break into houses," he said. "I decided only to go with food supplies." Over the last two years, he said, "everybody was using a gun and nobody will tell you that he is a looter."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He insists that he was not a thief but a protector when he rode alongside relief food convoys in a souped-up car full of weapons to ward off other attackers. As payment, he would get four or five sacks of food. Unfriendly Competition  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he was the breadwinner for 20 families -- his own family of 16 children, plus neighbors and friends. There were exchanges of fire over the food convoys, he said, his car of gunmen turning against their friends in a second vehicle when the other group tried to make an end run and divert the food trucks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We were together and this started a conflict between us," he said, describing how the two carloads fired at each other until the attacker ran out of ammunition and the theft was foiled.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Several weeks ago, in anticipation of the American landing, Mr. Ali modified his line of work. He now rides shotgun as a guard for a friend with a pickup truck. They hire themselves out as a package deal -- a taxi with its own protection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is waiting for the day when the Marines will show up to collect his AK-47 along with everyone else's. But he insists that he will give it up only to an American.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I give it to a Somali," he said, "he will kill me."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MOGADISHU, Somalia, Jan. 4 -- The United States Army has begun investigating the killing of a British relief official in the southern port of Kismayu and the discovery of 15 bodies in a grave outside the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diplomats and witnesses say there was a massacre in Kismayu just before American troops landed in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, on Dec. 9.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Col. Michael W. Hagee of the Marines, a military operations officer here, said today that the Army had sent criminal investigators to examine the bodies and look into the shooting of Sean Devereux, the officer in charge of the United Nations Children's Fund office in Kismayu. Unesco Withdraws Staff  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, they have not completed the investigation," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Devereaux, who was 28 years old, was shot in the back of the head and in the abdomen on Saturday night as he walked from the United Nations compound in Kismayu to his house about 100 yards away, United Nations officials said. Two Somali office staff members who were accompanying him were not hurt, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week Mr. Devereux was widely quoted in foreign news reports about the reported massacre. Many relief officials said they believed forces responsible for the massacre killed Mr. Devereux in retaliation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Witnesses and United States diplomats here say more than 100 religious leaders, business executives and prominent residents of the city were hunted door to door and killed in three nights of <b>terror</b>. The killings were directed by Col. Omar Jess, the clan leader who controls the city, the diplomats said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In response to the shooting of Mr. Devereux, Unesco evacuated its international staff from Kismayu, leaving a Somali staff to maintain feeding and health services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American troops entered the city last month and negotiated an agreement that would require Colonel Jess to remove his armed vehicles from the city.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Devereux was the first international relief worker to be killed in Somalia since troops from the United States and a coalition of other nations arrived to protect convoys of food aid from looters and gunmen.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TOKAI, Japan, Tuesday, Jan. 5 -- After a two-month journey that turned into a diplomatic embarrassment for the Japanese Government, a cargo vessel carrying more than a ton of plutonium from Europe arrived in Japan early this morning under heavy guard and lingering questions about the future of an ambitious nuclear program that has deeply alarmed Japan's neighbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The ship, the Akatsuki Maru, pulled into the harbor here 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, ending the largest sealift of plutonium ever attempted. About 500 demonstrators, organized by Greenpeace International and other anti-nuclear groups, jeered from the shore and from small motorboats off the harbor, but a fleet of circling helicopters, hundreds of riot police officers and a flotilla of dozens of guard ships brought the ship in at dawn this morning without incident.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Japanese officials declared the mission a success, despite open suspicions around Asia about Japan's motives, and assertions that the country is destabilizing the region by beginning commerce in material that can be fabricated into weapons fuel with relative ease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The plutonium is ultimately destined for use in a new generation of nuclear reactors that will use plutonium, rather than uranium, and will generate fuel as quickly as it consumes it. But because plutonium is also the fuel for nuclear weapons -- and because it ranks among the most toxic materials on earth -- the program has been criticized by environmentalists, groups opposing the spread of nuclear weapons, and neighboring governments that barred the ship from their waters. Future of Program Uncertain  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Almost as soon as the ship emerged from a dawn mist and docked here, workers began lifting huge containers of plutonium out of the hold and into a special, secure installation built here that the Japanese authorities say will protect the deadly plutonium against <b>terrorists</b> and other threats. But officials acknowledged that it was unclear whether the arrival of the ship marked the beginning or the end of Japan's efforts to ship 30 or more tons of the material to Japan in the next 20 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government was clearly taken aback by the ferocity of the protests and open distrust of its assurances, all reminders of the considerable wariness in Asia and other parts of the world over Japanese intentions and policies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This morning, Takao Ishiwatari, the head of semi-governmental organization responsible for the shipment, said Japan had erred in keeping details of its plan secret and thus created distrust among its neighbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In recent weeks a number of officials have suggested publicly that the policy is being reconsidered, especially after evidence that Japan's plans to import such vast amounts of plutonium would contribute to a quickly growing oversupply. Japan Fears Being Dependent  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrival of the specially fitted, carefully guarded ship culminated the first phase of a multibillion-dollar plan to ease one of Japan's greatest fears: that one day it could be cut off from the energy supplies that keep the world's second largest economy going.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Today's cargo of plutonium was extracted from Japanese nuclear waste, which was shipped years ago to a reprocessing plant near Cherbourg, France. It is the first of more than 30 planned shipments. Under the current plan, some of the reprocessing is to be done Britain, and after the turn of the century at a plant that is under construction in Japan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After fabricating the plutonium into special fuel here, a process that will take several years, it will be burned in an experimental breeder reactor that will in turn produce more plutonium. The idea is to produce a self-sustaining fuel cycle, in which each load of plutonium produces more, freeing Japan of reliance on foreign suppliers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Groups opposing the spread of nuclear weapons said the cargo ship and its sea escort, a lightly armed Japanese Coast Guard vessel, would prove an inviting target for <b>terrorists</b> once shipments became regular. Although the plutonium is intended for reactors, not weapons, experts say that as little as eight kilograms, or slightly more than 17 1/2 pounds, could be fashioned into a very crude nuclear weapon. By that measure, the load that arrived in Japan today would be sufficient to produce 100 to 150 weapons.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 -- The Commerce Department has scheduled an interagency meeting for Tuesday in a final effort to approve the sale of crop-duster aircraft to Iran and jet engines and satellite gear to China before President Bush leaves office, Administration officials said today.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sales are strongly opposed by the Defense Department, which is worried about increasing the military power of the two countries, and about the precedent the sale could set for the export of even more advanced commercial equipment with potential military applications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Administration is also considering whether to allow the sale of a petrochemical factory to Iran but will not decide this issue on Tuesday. The factory would produce as a byproduct large quantities of hydrogen cyanide, a primitive chemical-warfare gas that, unlike a related chemical, potassium cyanide, is not considered militarily useful, an Administration official said this afternoon. First Sale of Planes in Decade  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If approved, the delivery of 10 single-seat crop-dusters to Iran would be the first sale of American aircraft to Teheran since the bombing of the United States Marine barracks in Lebanon in October 1983, when 241 Americans were killed. Iran was suspected of involvement in the bombing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The jet engines are intended for use in Chinese military training aircraft, but a Defense Department analysis found that their components could also be used to build cruise missiles that could fly farther and carry a heavier payload than anything now in the Chinese arsenal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The satellite gear consists of a cesium-beam laser component that would be used as a clock to coordinate other satellite systems. Commerce vs. Defense  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Federal law requires Government approval for the transfer of technology with potential military applications to nations that have Communist governments or have been labeled by the State Department as supporters of <b>terrorism</b>, as Iran has.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approval process has deeply divided the Administration, three officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Commerce Department has advocated the sales as necessary to insure that United States businesses do not lose foreign markets.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">State Department officials have been busy with the arms control agreement with Russia signed on Sunday and have not taken an active role in the dispute, said all three officials, who insisted on anonymity. Some Find Consensus Unlikely  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Policy Coordinating Committee on technology transfers, which has representatives from the State, Defense and Commerce Departments, will meet Tuesday at the request of the Commerce Department to try to form a consensus on the sales. One official predicted that the committee would be unable to reach a consensus because of the Defense Department's concerns, and would forward the issue to a top interagency committee, which is unlikely to meet before Mr. Bush leaves office on Jan. 20.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But another official said many in the Administration felt that because the sales deals had been struck during Mr. Bush's tenure, there was an obligation to resolve them rather than leave them to President-elect Bill Clinton.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The crop-dusters represent the most difficult issue because many people associated them with gas warfare. Use in Gas Warfare Disputed  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq has long been rumored to have used crop-dusters to dump lethal chemical gases on Kurdish civilians, but no evidence has ever been found to prove that crop-dusters were used, said Anthony H. Cordesman, an adjunct professor of national security studies at Georgetown University. A recent study by the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency found that crop-dusters would be very difficult to use for chemical warfare because the pilots would be likely to be killed by the gas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The United States has already allowed the sale of several European jetliners with American parts to Iran, but has barred any sale of completely American-made planes. The Boeing Company tentatively agreed last year to sell nearly $1 billion worth of jetliners to Iran Air if American policy were to change and allow such sales.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the United States does not sell the crop-dusters, other countries will do so, said Fred P. Ayres, the chairman and owner of the Ayres Corporation. The company, based in Albany, Ga., is seeking permission to export 10 of its Ayres Turbo Thrush crop-dusters to Iran. Poland and Russia are already leasing 100 crop-dusters to Iran, he said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CAIRO, Jan. 4 -- Breaking a lull in sectarian violence in Egypt, attacks have resumed against Coptic Christians and churches as well as police officials, dealing a blow to official assertions that Muslim fundamentalist <b>terror</b> was brought under control with a security sweep in December.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In separate incidents a few minutes apart this morning, assailants in Dairut, a fundamentalist stronghold 200 miles south of Cairo, shot and killed an elderly Coptic farm manager and wounded a Coptic pharmacist. On Sunday night, a Coptic church was burned in Dairut, where Copts make up 20 percent of the population. In Cairo, security officials said that a police car had been burned in suburb of Imbaba, which has been under heavy police surveillance since early last month. Assurance Was Premature  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attacks came after President Hosni Mubarak and Interior Minister Abdel Halim Moussa had gone out of their way in the last few days to reassure foreign tourists as well as the Egyptian people that Islamic fundamentalist violence had been checked in the security crackdown, the most extensive in two decades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 14,000 members of the Central Security Forces raided Imbaba, and thousands more descended on Dairut and Asyut, viewed as the Islamic militants' primary strongholds in southern Egypt. The raids were accompanied by a campaign on Government-controlled television and in newspapers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moussa said that more than 1,700 people had been detained on suspicion of taking part in an organized campaign to challenge Government authority and wreck the country's $3 billion tourist industry.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The flow of tourists dropped by more than 60 percent in December after a series of attacks by Islamic militants on British, German and Russian tourists. A British woman was killed. Insufficient Vigilance Charged  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These assaults followed a yearlong campaign in which at least 70 Copts and dozens of Egyptian officers were killed in clashes with the militants. Government critics, particularly Copts, have charged that these killings were treated lightly, encouraging the extension of violence to tourists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attacks today coincided with the opening of a meeting in Tunis at which the interior ministers of Egypt, Algeria and Tunisia sought to widen cooperation and exchange intelligence on the activities of Muslim fundamentalists in their three countries.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The meeting was part of a larger gathering of 17 Arab interior ministers that is to anticipate security problems of the region over the next five years, with violence by fundamentalists at the top of the list. This practice is now widespread in Algeria, Tunisia, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The resurgence of violence coincides with the effort by the Mubarak Government to address its causes, in what amounts to its first acknowledgement that poverty, neglect and poor planning will continue to feed rebellion unless they are dealt with. Tolerance but Also Control  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A senior policy planner here said that a continuing review would include revamping religious education in schools starting in the 1994 school year, taking control of 120,000 mosques that have sprung up in the last decade outside the Government's authority to become pulpits for extremist preachers, and launching a major evaluation of television programs and cultural activities with the aims of instilling a sense of religious tolerance toward minorities and of openness to social change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Egyptian intellectuals and Coptic leaders have called in the last few months for such reforms, arguing that challenging the extremists with police force alone was not sufficient.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Government has to reverse the policy of dehumanizing and marginalizing Copts in the school system as well as in the governing establishment," said Milad Hanna, a professor at Cairo's engineering faculty and a doyen of the 7 million to 8 million Egyptian Copts in this nation of 56 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We must recognize Coptic culture for what it is," Mr. Hanna said, "a component of Egyptian history over centuries of time that has created the present identity of Egypt."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an underground facility, somewhere in the United States, researchers are going through a mountain of Iraqi files that could provide the legal basis for the first case of genocide ever to be brought before the World Court.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The materials, captured by Kurdish rebels in the uprising against Saddam Hussein immediately following the Persian Gulf war, provide the first written documentation of a campaign of <b>terror</b> waged for a decade against the four million Kurds in Iraq, a campaign that reached its zenith between March and August of 1988.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Like Gestapo files and those of the Stasi, the East German intelligence agency that trained Iraq's security police, the Iraqi documents set forth in chillingly bureaucratic language the "liquidations," "expulsions" and "transfers" of Kurdish victims, who are almost invariably referred to as "saboteurs," "criminals," "traitors" and "human cargo."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Dear Comrades," states an order from the Baath Party People's Command in Zakho, dated June 14, 1987. "The entry of any kind of human cargo, nutritional supplies, or mechanical instruments into the security-prohibited villages under the second stage [ of the operation ] is strictly prohibited. . . .

A new group arrived today at 12:00 hours at the village of Zitah. It has been demolished and razed to the ground. So have the following other villages: Tirli, Delirabir, Bedran, Zarara, Sitri, Zarkan, Shanbadar. The groups are continuing their advance to their other targets."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Your letter, Secret and Personal, 10551, dated 21/August/1989," starts another. "We enclosed herewith lists containing an inventory of the names of the criminals who received the People's Judgment . . . together with a summary of each crime and the date each was executed." Among them is Dalshad Mohammed Amin Fatah Mriwan, who was killed on March 13, 1989. "This criminal," a teacher at Shawrash Boys High School, the report states, "was teaching the Kurdish Language using Latin letters because of his chauvinistic and separatist beliefs, especially that he was one of the saboteur groups' intellectuals. He is the subject of our cable 7371 in 13/March/89."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still another: "Secret and Confidential. From: Office of the Secretariat, Sulaimaniyah Security Department, Date, 10/1988. The information you relayed to us in the aforementioned letter concerning the execution of the just sentence (death sentence) in the case of the criminal Jemal Ahmad Huma Khan has been confirmed. He was thus sentenced for attacking the character of the President and Commander-in-Chief Saddam Hussein (may God preserve and protect him), and for questioning the decision of the Revolutionary Command Council, which is well known for its complete and total mercy. [ Signature illegible ] Security Director, Governate of Sulaimaniyah."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, "From The Presidency, Directorate General of Security, Sulaymaniyah Security Directorate/ Investigations. To: Asst. Dir. Operations for Autonomous Region, Esq. Greetings. Referring to the telephone conversation, we list hereunder" five categories of "enemies" of Iraq, including "(6) families numbering (18) persons, relatives of the criminal mentioned in the 'First' [ category ] above, executed by this directorate, according to directions from the esteemed North Organization Bureau' (2,532) persons and (1,869) families numbering (6,030) persons, were sent to the Popular Army Camp in Ta'amim Governorate. These were arrested during the heroic 'Al Anfal' Operation."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE EVIDENCE OF SADDAM Hussein's savage persecution, his extermination of vast numbers of his country's Kurds, pours forth in numbing, almost mundane fashion. It is contained in 857 cartons of documents currently stored at a building of the United States National Archives at a location that, for security reasons, cannot be disclosed. The official Iraqi documents -- more than 14 tons of them, totaling more than four million pages -- provide a detailed picture of the day-to-day operations of the Iraqi Government and its security apparatus as they carried out what researchers now believe was genocide against the Iraqi Kurds.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are thousands of tattered files, often partly burned, torn or water-stained, held together in characteristic Iraqi fashion with shoelaces and sewing pins. The files contain reports ranging from the banal to the horrific -- routine vacation requests, administrative and personnel ledgers, payroll records of mercenaries and informants, intercepted letters and postcards -- and almost incidentally, page upon page of authorizations of "purifications," "liquidations" and other euphemisms for mass murder.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working in secrecy until now, Arabic linguists, computer specialists, social scientists and researchers from Middle East Watch, a private, New York-based human rights organization -- with logistical help from the United States Defense Intelligence Agency -- have been reading, sorting, collating, recording and analyzing the material. This highly unusual collaboration between a Government intelligence agency and a rights-advocacy group -- the two are normally at loggerheads -- is aimed at an even more unusual objective: information in these documents is being used by Middle East Watch to prepare the first case of genocide ever to be brought before the International Court of Justice, in The Hague.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Peter Galbraith, a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who helped expose the Anfal campaign and whose committee is now the legal custodian of the documents, says the case against Iraq is strong. "I don't think we shall ever find a 'smoking gun document,' a paper signed by Saddam Hussein ordering the murder of three innocent shepherds," says Galbraith. "But neither did we ever find minutes of the meeting at Wansee at which Hitler ordered the eradication of the Jews. There never was a 'Final Solution' order as such. But we have physical evidence of horrific crimes in these documents, official Iraqi videotapes of interrogation sessions, torture, executions and rape, and in the grave sites of now autonomous Kurdistan.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we have, in effect, are the individual receipts for murder, often in the driest, must bureaucratic language. There must be consequences for such institutionalized savagery."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A case, if successful, could result in the first condemnations for genocide by the highest international court since the Nazi regime and its senior officials were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg tribunals more than 40 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew Whitley, director of Middle East Watch, says the documents provide the clearest description to date of the inner workings of the "heroic Anfal" campaign, which extended from March to September 1988. Anfal, an Arabic term from the Koran, refers to an incident in which followers of the Muslim prophet Mohammed raided and pillaged nonbelievers. Anfal, literally booty, was a six-stage military campaign against the Kurds -- a counterinsurgency gone wild.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Anfal may constitute a particular act of genocide, "it was surely the culmination of a decade-long campaign of genocide," says Joost Hiltermann, a Dutch member of Middle East Watch who investigated human rights abuses in northern Iraq. "In Anfal alone, perhaps as many as 180,000 people disappeared, thousands of whom were shot and buried in mass graves or virtually starved to death in a prison in the desert."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Iraq argues that it acted only against Kurdish rebels, who have for decades sought autonomy from Baghdad. To make matters worse, the Iraqis say, the rebels were supporting Teheran in the brutal eight-year war with Iraq, which ended in August 1988. But Anfal was directed against civilians as well as rebels, and it was carried out only after Iran's defeat became all but inevitable. Iraq further maintains that the documents are forgeries -- fabrications by Kurds on official Iraqi stationery that was stolen when police and military installations were overrun during the ill-fated uprisings against Saddam in March and April of 1991, soon after the Persian Gulf war.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Human rights and Government analysts say this claim is ludicrous, that the Kurds could not possibly have produced so huge a volume of material in so short a time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Besides, they add, there is further evidence of Iraq's crimes against humanity in what the Kurds call Kurdistan. This is an area of northern Iraq -- larger than Massachusetts and New Jersey combined -- that coalition forces carved out as a security zone after the gulf war, when Saddam Hussein's butchery sent thousands of Kurds scurrying to safety in neighboring Turkey and Iran. The Kurds now govern the region, with their own legal, political and administrative institutions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evidence against Iraq can be heard, seen and touched. It can also be smelled. The stench from as yet unopened mass graves still permeates the cold mountain air.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING the documents, Middle East Watch has interviewed hundreds of survivors of and witnesses to mass killings, chemical attacks, torture and the destruction of villages in northern Iraq. The rights group and the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights have also unearthed physical evidence of mass murder through exhumations of mass graves in the area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even to the untrained eye, evidence of mass crimes against humanity is overwhelming. The Kurdish landscape is littered with the rubble of some 4,000 villages and hamlets that were systematically destroyed by the Iraqis -- the exact number may never be known. Kurdistan looks as if it has been leveled by an earthquake.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But interviews and the documents confirm that this was no act of nature. First, the villages were "purified," as the documents say -- emptied of "saboteurs" and other human life, sometimes by chemical attacks but more often by shelling or bombing. Property and livestock were methodically looted by Iraqi troops. Mud huts were bulldozed, cement structures were dynamited and wells were plugged with cement or poisoned. In some villages, especially near the borders, fields were mined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a typical case, the analysts say, fleeing inhabitants were trapped by Iraqi soldiers, to whom many surrendered. In at least two cases -- the villages of Koreme and Mergatoo, in Dohuk Governorate -- men and boys were executed on the spot. In other cases, villagers were taken to holding facilities, from which they were, as the Kurds say, using that terrible and all too familiar expression, "disappeared." This pattern was repeated again and again. Kurdish leaders and rights workers estimate that between 500,000 and 750,000 Iraqi Kurds were displaced from their homes in the last decade. There is barely a family that has not lost one or several members -- to torture, chemical attacks, land mines, deportation or to disappearance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kurdistan now is a treeless land. Because oil-rich Iraq has cut off heating oil and most other supplies, the Kurds have been forced to chop down most of their forests for fuel. And thousands of Kurds have lost arms and legs to the mines planted by Iraq and Iran during their war and by Baghdad in its war against them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the joy so many Kurds express about their liberation, there is at the same time widespread fear and desperation. Women in black, holding tiny portraits of missing relatives, surround the cars of Western visitors, wailing for help. Some are hungry, and all crave information about the fate of those they suspect, but dare not admit, are probably long dead. Other Kurds, fearful that Saddam will return, plead with visitors for help in securing a visa -- to the United States, to Europe, anywhere.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE DOCUMENTS AND THE evidence collected inside Iraq are the critical components of the case Middle East Watch is building that Iraq's persecution of its Kurds constitutes genocide -- defined by the 1948 convention ratified by 107 countries, including Iraq, as acts aimed "with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No genocide case has ever even been argued before the World Court. Such cases are enormously difficult to bring, let alone win. They must be sponsored by a government against a government -- not by or against individuals -- and few governments are willing to accuse another of such heinous conduct.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That partly explains why no case has been brought against the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia. "We have overwhelming documentary and eyewitness evidence that this was a genocide with a capital G," says Gregory Stanton, a lawyer who heads the Cambodian Genocide Project. "But there is a lack of political will by governments to act."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whatever nation is ultimately asked to sponsor the case against Iraq, it will not be the United States. Lawyers for Middle East Watch say they do not want a genocide case to be construed internationally as a continuation of the Persian Gulf war. In any event, Washington should not be a plaintiff, having rejected World Court jurisdiction when Nicaragua charged it with war crimes for mining its harbors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, Whitley says, America's complicity in Iraq's military buildup makes it a poor plaintiff. While Bush Administration officials maintain they were unaware of the nature and extent of Saddam's campaign against the Kurds, a declassified Defense Intelligence Agency report obtained by Whitley's group under the Freedom of Information Act challenges these assertions. The report to Washington from the American Embassy in Baghdad, dated April 19, 1988, states that an estimated 1.5 million Kurds had already been resettled in camps and that "an unknown but reportedly large number of Kurds have been placed in 'cowcentration' [ sic ] camps located near the Jordanian and Saudi Arabian borders."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although only a small number of the captured Iraqi documents have been analyzed, Middle East Watch is confident that a plaintiff government will be found (several governments have already been approached, and some have expressed interest). With the United States now naming Serbian leaders who should be charged with war crimes for atrocities committed in Bosnia, rights advocates say the Iraqi case takes on even greater significance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the purest case I have ever seen since the Nazis," says Aryeh Neier, executive director of Human Rights Watch, the parent group for Middle East Watch. "If Saddam Hussein and his regime are not held responsible for ethnic murder on such a scale, how will Serbia or any other state in which tribal, clan and religious rivalries threaten civilized behavior be deterred?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THOUGH ENORMOUS, THE cache of documents is only part of the written record against Saddam's regime. The files now in the archives belong to the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, one of the two major Kurdish political parties, whose guerrillas seized them. After elaborate negotiations among Galbraith, Whitley and Jalal Talabani, the head of the party, the Patriotic Union agreed to permit the United States Air Force to fly the material to America for copying and safekeeping. The Kurdish Democratic Party, led by Massoud Barzani, also has substantial quantities of documents, but they remain in northern Iraq, largely inaccessible to Western analysts.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What strikes the researchers about the documents they have been poring over in their bleak facility is what one called the "routine" way in which Iraqi officials described their torment of the Kurds. "They made it all sound, well, so normal," says one researcher, who, fearful of Iraqi retaliation, as are all the researchers, spoke on condition that he not be named. "The Iraqis kept records on everything. They were, above all, consummate bureaucrats."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bureaucracy could be trivially specific. The researchers found reports noting the names of a group of Brazilian artists who had exhibited their work in Israel, Iraq's enemy. There is a letter from the Revolutionary Command Council ordering the annual commemoration of the infamous 1982 Hama massacre of Syrians by President Hafez al-Assad's regime in 1982 (presumably to remind fellow Iraqis of their treacherous neighbor's misdeeds). The earliest document found so far is a 1953 file about a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party. The man had inadvertently called attention to himself by applying for a passport.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents also reflect a typical governmental passion for secrecy and euphemism. Virtually everything -- including an order implementing summer hours in the northern Kurdish provinces -- is marked "Secret and Confidential." One file contains a particularly poignant black-and-white photo of an 8-year-old girl, described as having "returned to the national ranks," an Iraqi reference to fugitives who have surrendered to the Government.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents reveal a certain pride in the murderous campaign against the rebellious Kurds. One refers to the creation of an "Anfal Section" within Saddam's ruling Baath Party, evidently to commemorate an endeavor that the party deemed noble and successful. Another illustrates the importance Baghdad placed on driving the Kurds -- not only the guerrillas but all noncombatants -- out of their villages. It refers to the "Prohibited Villages Committee of Central Security," indicating that the de-Kurdization campaign was of sufficient priority to merit a full committee to oversee its implementation and evaluation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another document contains what is believed to be the first complete list of all the "prohibited" villages, hundreds of tiny Kurdish settlements in Erbil Governorate that Iraq decided to obliterate because it thought they were harboring rebels, or might do so in the future. In several cases, the documents have enabled the researchers to resolve mysteries arising from interviews in the field.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In July, for instance, Joost Hiltermann, the researcher for Middle East Watch, interviewed a Kurd who said that more than 100 people from his village of Bileh had "disappeared." But none of the Kurds interviewed knew what had happened to these people. In November, a researcher found a handwritten field report from the security service in the district of Sadiq, dated June 3, 1988, that noted that on the "2nd and the 3rd, 30 families from the village of Bileh Juru [ upper Bileh ] were received by the military command of QR45. They were counted and surveyed by us. We will presently send you lists of their names, addresses, and birth dates."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is no record of what happened to the people after this. But researchers now have proof that they were in the Government's hands at the time they disappeared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, the documents suggest that the Iraqi bureaucracy was just as hidebound as any other. One file contains an attack by three senior intelligence officials on the Government's policy of arresting the relatives of deserters and rebels to induce their return. The report, dated Aug. 7, 1985, concludes that the policy, far from stopping defections and desertions, actually drove more people to the "enemy's line of revolution." Despite this unanimous conclusion, subsequent records show, authorities went on arresting the relatives of fugitives.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EVEN THE DOCUMENTS DO NOT prepare a visitor for a trip through the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, now in the throes of a precarious liberation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Consider a fortress in Atrush. Eyewitnesses say that in March 1991, after the Kurdish uprising failed, Iraqi soldiers machine-gunned between 12 and 20 Kurdish men and their families less than 100 yards outside the walls. The bodies were placed in a shallow pit lined with dynamite and then blown to bits. A bulldozer covered them with a little coffee-colored earth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stench of the grave site must have disgusted the Iraqi soldiers. For soon after the massacre, it appears, soldiers placed phosphorous rocks atop the mass grave to mask the odor. The phosphorous deodorant was ineffective; 14 months later, the scent of human decomposition remains, even though the site has yet to be excavated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From other excavations, it is obvious that many victims were shot at fairly close range. Head scarves Iraqis used to blindfold Kurds before killing them were still attached to the skulls. The rope used to tie the hands of the men, women and children remains, long after the victims have decomposed. So do clothing and human hair. One excavation team pulled a perfectly preserved woman's braid out of one mass grave. The remains are being carefully catalogued, to present as physical evidence at the trial.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the genocide case so far rests on the testimony of survivors, only six of whom have been identified to date. Aziz Wahab Mohammed -- his friends call him Ozer -- is one of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A deserter from the Iraqi military (like so many Kurds), he was 25 years old when he surrendered to Iraqi troops who surrounded Khidr Reihan, the village in which he was living, in April 1988. The Iraqi Army's Kurdish soldiers (known as Jahsh and believed to have once numbered as many as 240,000) assured him that he would not be harmed. They would merely interrogate him, they said, and return him to the military.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he and his friends were trucked first to a police station in Qader Karam, where they were kept without food or water for two days, and then to the headquarters of the Baath Party's Popular Army in Topzawa, where they were held for four more days -- again without sustenance. "The Iraqi people knew what was happening to us," Ozer says. "I remember seeing two women by the road as our convoy passed by. They were applauding."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Topzawa -- the last stop for many thousands of the disappeared -- personal possessions were confiscated and prisoners were interrogated. Ozer estimates that about 15,000 Kurds of all ages and sexes were in the facility when he was there. One badly wounded man in his cell said he had been beaten with a cable, hanged from a ceiling fan and scorched with hot steel, and that guards had walked on his back with their boots. His crime was that he had a beard, which is taken as a sign of adherence to Islamic fundamentalism. That night, Ozer and a friend who had smuggled nail scissors into the cell, cut off the man's beard and those of five others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From Topzawa, which was under the command of the Baath Party, they were put in police minibuses that stank of human waste and were driven south to the city of Ramadi, close to Baghdad, and then into the desert. The road ended and the convoy, accompanied by police cars and bulldozers, continued down a dirt road into a grove of date palms. Ozer's bus, the 35th and next to last in line, got stuck in the sand. So did the last bus. The lights of his vehicle were turned on bright and Ozer saw the Kurdish passengers of other buses dragged out and made to stand in front of a ditch about 12 feet away. "They were murdered in the glare of our headlights," he recalls.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ozer and his friends decided to fight. When the Iraqis came for them, the four strongest prisoners lunged at their guards, who then riddled the van with bullets. Though he was hit in the leg, Ozer managed in the ensuing chaos to jump out of the bus and run away. But in his panic, he fell into the ditch filled with the bodies of the men from the other van.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trench was huge -- about 6 feet wide, 10 to 12 feet deep and very long. It was filled with bodies and blood. He landed on his back, on top of another body. He remembers that it gurgled as he landed. Slowly, he crawled toward the shallow end of the trench, which contained, he says, about 400 bodies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There, he managed to scramble out. Since his skin was the color of the sand, he removed all his clothes, stuffed them into his jacket and ran. In the moonlight, he passed dozens of other trenches, also filled with bodies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MARIAM MOHAMMED JAWAR no longer has her wedding ring. She sold it years ago to buy food for her family. But she does have a tiny photo of her husband, Abdullah, a stone mason, and of her son, a civil servant in Iraq's Ministry of Agriculture. Both men were seized by Iraqi soldiers in the Kurdish town of Harir in the summer of 1983, five years before the Anfal campaign began.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The arrest of some 8,000 men from Harir and other areas inhabited by families belonging to the Barzani clan was Saddam's response to Massoud Barzani's collaboration with Iran during the Iran-Iraq war. "They even took boys as young as 7," Mariam says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ever since, she has been waiting for her men to return, or for official word that they are dead.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April 1988, Saddam Hussein visited the Barzani widows, as they are known, in a nationally televised event. "Eighteen helicopters flew over this camp and I said to myself, This is Saddam," Mariam recalls.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the people raced to the main square. He was standing there in the middle of it," she says. Overcoming her fear, Mariam pushed her way to the front of the crowd, past the Kalashnikov-toting soldiers and bodyguards, and grabbed Saddam by the lapels of his uniform. "I put my head on his chest and said, 'Where have you taken our men all these years?' He answered me! He said he had come here to give us title to the houses we had been living in since we were expelled from our villages in 1979. And then he added, 'All the living will be released to you.' "  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mariam says that the town celebrated for a week, but that she never believed Saddam. She knew that none of the men would return. And none ever have.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pain of not knowing the fate of husbands and sons is a searing legacy of Saddam's war against the Kurds. In this conservative Muslim society, women cannot mourn the dead, remarry or get on with their lives without proof that their spouses are dead. So they live in what one Kurdish aid worker calls "hopeless hope."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documents confirm the Harir disappearances. One message, dated Oct. 11, 1986 -- six months after Saddam's visit -- notes that children less than 12 years old were left in the compound when the men were "expelled" in 1983. Since several years had passed, many of the children would now be 15 or 16, old enough to join the collaborationist Kurdish units that were helping suppress fellow Kurds. "Please provide us with the name of those in the aforementioned families who have volunteered for the above regiment and other regiments," the order states.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NAILA AJIL KHISHMAN IS 12. She was 7 when her parents and eight brothers and sisters were rounded up after surrendering to the military in 1987 in the village of Girbkhabar. The village was leveled a month later. There were 500 people in her village. All of them were taken. And all but Naila and a few others have disappeared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She is alive because she and her uncle Ibrahim were placed in a different transport truck from the rest of her family. When her truck stopped in a neighboring town, a cousin spotted her and helped her escape while a Kurdish guard wasn't looking.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Kurdish branch of Save the Children, in the town of Koi Sanjaq, estimates that in this governorate alone, some 3,000 children have lost one or both parents in the Anfal. These orphans, too, are part of the legacy of genocide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KURDISH LEADERS SAY THAT Anfal was a psychological breaking point. After the Anfal, virtually all Kurds stopped thinking of themselves as Iraqis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was because of Anfal that two and a half million people fled when the uprising against Saddam failed in 1991," says Sami Abdul Rahman, a leader of the Unified Socialist Party, a minority party in Kurdistan's new Government and Parlament. "Only Anfal explains why such vast numbers of people braved hunger and cold in Turkey or Iran rather than stay and face Saddam's fury."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rahman knows this firsthand. His father died in the mountains, trying to flee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Few Kurdish leaders hold out hopes of a Kurdish state. Given the presence of large numbers of Kurds in neighboring Turkey, Iran and Syria, and those nations' hostility to the Kurds' fragile experiment with autonomy, they assume that Kurdistan will never be permitted to become an independent nation-state.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is a final perverse paradox: Saddam Hussein has become the guarantor of Kurdish independence. "I pray every night for his well being," says Jamal Aziz Amin, the leader of the Patriotic Union in Sulaimaniya, Kurdistan's largest "liberated" city. "Because as long as he is there, our autonomous enclave will be protected by the gulf war allies. After that, who knows?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amin, a former school principal and secret member of the union, was held in an Iraqi prison in Sulaimaniya and tortured for more than a year. "They used to tie my hands behind my back and attach me to a hook in the ceiling. Sometimes, the Iraqis attached electrodes to various parts of my body, to increase the pain. But I never confessed," he says. "They killed anyone who did."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One day after the Kurds took control of the prison in which he had been held, Amin confronted the man -- a captain in the security police -- who had tortured him: "At first, he pretended that he didn't know me. Then he cried and begged for mercy, saying he was only carrying out orders. For some reason, the fury I had felt toward him for so long just went out of me. I told him not to worry. He would not be killed, that we were turning them all over to the Iraqis, which we did, even though I knew in my heart that he would wind up torturing new people in Iraqi jails."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Amin says that the Iraqis were let go because the Kurds, having suffered so much at Iraq's hands, will never do to others what was done to them. Perhaps not. But the experience so far in northern Iraq is hardly reassuring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In September, the Patriotic Union and the Kurdish Democratic Party formed their own new intelligence agency, called Asaysh, or "security" in Kurdish, to prevent infiltrators from Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey from destabilizing the area.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Officially, no one can be arrested without a court order, and torture is illegal. But in the Kurdish security prison in Sulaimaniya, two Kurds complained that they had been in prison on the day of their alleged crime. And many in this prison, they said, had been tortured -- hanged just as the Iraqis had once done, with their hands bound behind them. Prisoners displayed the telltale black-and-blue marks on their wrists. Some Kurds have learned -- despite, or because of, their enormous suffering -- a few of their oppressor's worst habits. The urge to violence, it seems, is not just an Iraqi failing, but a human one. EVIDENCE GROWS ON BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers working with the captured Iraqi documents say they have not found a "smoking gun," a document signed by Saddam Hussein ordering the annihilation of Iraq's Kurds. But they have already produced the first official Iraqi reference to Baghdad's possession of biological weapons. Iraq denies that it possesses such weapons, and United Nation's inspection teams have conducted 47 fruitless missions in Iraq, searching for chemical and biological arms or proof of their existence.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late November, Middle East Watch obtained in Kurdistan a document stamped "Top Secret/ Confidential." Dated Aug. 3, 1986, the memorandum from the commander of military intelligence in Arbil specifically orders division units to count their stocks of "Bio-Chemical Materials" and to report back to headquarters as soon as possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Analysts for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, shown the document, say it appears genuine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have long suspected that Iraq had developed biological weapons. In September 1988, Dlawer Ala'Aldeen, a Kurdish microbiologist and doctor at the University of Nottingham Hospital and Medical School in England, accused Iraq of starting an outbreak of typhoid fever in the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniya. Major outbreaks of typhoid from contaminated water almost always involve several different strains of bacteria, he said. But the 1988 outbreak in the city stemmed from a single strain, suggesting that it was the result of an artificially produced agent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the time, Ala'Aldeen said, he had no documentary evidence to support his allegation. In late 1990, however, he was shown a copy of the same memorandum obtained by Middle East Watch this fall. He included it in a report that was privately published in England in January 1991, entitled "Death Clouds: Saddam Hussein's Chemical War Against the Kurds."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had very little money," he said, "So I printed only a few hundred copies and sent them to libraries in England. No one took much notice."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The elegiac theme of social exile haunts THE HANGING VALLEY (Scribners, $20), the fourth rural police procedural in Peter Robinson's evocative series set in the north of England and featuring his thoughtful copper, Chief Inspector Alan Banks. When a decomposed corpse is discovered fouling the pure country air of Yorkshire, Banks settles into the village of Swainshead to puzzle out the connection between the dead man, a Canadian schoolteacher named Bernard Allen, and an earlier unsolved murder of another stranger. The locals provide Banks with intriguing psychological material -- the detective is especially taken with the innkeeper's wife, who puts him in mind of Tess of the d'Urbervilles -- but no explanation for their obvious abhorrence of outsiders. It takes a field trip to Toronto for Banks to understand the character of the victim and what he represented to the Hardy esque residents of the valley.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At least Bernie died in the place he wanted to live," Banks is told at one of the many snug pubs where he conducts his most productive research. Cold comfort, one might think; but not in the context of this emotionally rich novel, in which death seems preferable to life in endless exile from the "green and pleasant land" of one's home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nancy Pickard proves a happy choice to complete THE 27-INGREDIENT CHILI CON CARNE MURDERS (Delacorte, $18) from a story begun by Virginia Rich, a onetime food writer and, at the time of her death in 1984, the author of three charming culinary mysteries that became the models for countless insipid imitations. Although entirely respectful of Rich's unadorned narrative style and the unassuming manner of her elderly heroine, the widowed Eugenia Potter, Ms. Pickard drops some broad hints that she intends to liven up the series. More power to her -- so long as she continues to cook up the original recipes for which Rich's delightful books were celebrated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, the rejuvenated Mrs. Potter experiences every cook's ultimate nightmare -- three people keel over dead after feasting on one of her famous meals -- when she returns from Maine to her Arizona cattle spread to lead the search for her missing ranch manager and his daughter. While dishing out some assertively flavored Mexican meals to the search party (check out the chiles rellenos recipe on the back cover), the heroine cannily sizes up their potential as murder suspects, even going up in a plane for a better view of how her neighbors are running their ranches. By the time that Mrs. Potter fingers the ill-mannered guest who spiked her chili, Ms. Pickard has given the protagonist a terrific new lease on life, as a vigorous outdoorswoman as much at home on a working ranch as she ever was in her little cottage in Maine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No woman, with the possible exception of Medea, has ever had a stronger motive for vengeance than Lily Forrester, the glamorous but nerve-racked heroine of Nancy Taylor Rosenberg's high-strung legal thriller, MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES (Dutton, $21). An ambitious prosecuting attorney in the California court system, Lily is the new chief of the sex crimes division and has her heart set on a judgeship when an ex-con breaks into her home to rape and <b>terrorize</b> her and her 13-year-old daughter. Lily grabs her shotgun, stalks this monster, whom she recognizes as the suspect in a case of multiple murder, and blows him away.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"An eye for an eye," declares Lily in the self-conscious idiom that helps to make her such a preposterous figure. "All she had done was don the executioner's mask. The judgment had been rendered by a greater power." Even Medea would choke on dialogue like that.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one would accuse Ms. Rosenberg, a former police officer, of resorting to subtlety in her first novel. You name it -- incest, gang rape, mental trauma, domestic cruelty, teen-age angst, the Los Angeles riots -- and it lands on Lily's groaning plate. For all the adrenaline that the author pumps into her story, her writing is far more persuasive when it isn't so feverish -- during intimate mother-daughter exchanges, for example, and in the realistically mundane procedures of ordinary, hard-working cops and lawyers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Get out the rubber hoses -- here comes John Lutz with another savage entertainment in the hard-boiled detective series he sets in that surreal hell he calls Florida. SPARK (Holt, $19.95) opens with Fred Carver, Mr. Lutz's brave and often foolhardy brute of a private eye, in a mellow mood, eager to be of service to an elderly schoolteacher disturbed by anonymous notes telling her that her husband did not die of a heart attack but was murdered. Everything seems to be on the up and up, according to the medical staff of Solartown, the retirement village outside Orlando where the couple made their home, until Carver's snooping activates "a kinky kinda homicidal maniac" who goes after him with an arsenal of lethal weapons that includes the disabled detective's own cane.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sadistic beatings that Carver takes from this mad-dog killer seem a bit excessive, although the nasty things going on at Solartown tend to warrant Mr. Lutz's displays of violence, if not his hero's time-wasting sexual heroics. And, as always, we do admire the palpable sense of place in this series, and especially the author's bottomless stock of heat imagery: "The heat hit him like a falling wall." "The heat struck him like a softly wrapped hammer." "The heat attacked him as if he'd just flung open a blast furnace door." That Carver, he'll always be a glutton for punishment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first person to die in Jean Hager's RAVENMOCKER (Mysterious Press/Warner, $17.95) is Abner Mouse, a Cherokee elder whose living heart and eternal soul may have been stolen by a ravenmocker, "the most dreaded of Cherokee witches." This provocative suggestion is quickly discounted, however, when Molly Bearpaw, an investigator for an American Indian advocacy agency and the house sleuth in this new series, attends Abner's autopsy and discovers that he died of botulism. After a second case of poisoning at the Oklahoma nursing home where Abner was a patient, the ravenmocker herring is dropped for good; as, indeed, are all references to Cherokee beliefs and customs. What remains is a tightly plotted but bloodlessly conventional whodunit that might just as well have been set in Tampa or St. Petersburg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike Mitchell Bushyhead, the Cherokee police chief who figures in Ms. Hager's other series, young Molly Bearpaw lacks experience and official credentials to conduct an authoritative investigation, and before long she's hanging on the accommodating arm of a local cop, begging for handouts. Molly's college degree in anthropology, along with her "understanding and respect for the old ways" of her people, suggests that her future cases might yet be set in a richer cultural context. But as debuts go, this one's pretty dull.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To the Editor:  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Regarding "Japan's Nuclear Fiasco" and Japan's would-be stockpile of plutonium for its breeder reactor becoming a target for <b>terrorists</b> -- the spent fuel of ordinary uranium-burning reactors contains a mixture of plutonium isotopes. Plutonium bombs consist of almost pure Pu-239 and allow for less than 1 percent contamination of Pu-240. The Japanese shipments contain over 20 percent Pu-240 in addition to other contaminants. Isotopes of the same element cannot be separated chemically. The separation of Pu-239 would require huge plants that are out of the question even for the Japanese Government. This is clearly no project for a <b>terrorist</b>.
